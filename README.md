## 🌟 What is CRISIS-AI?

CRISIS-AI is the world's first **100% offline voice assistant** specifically designed for emergency response during natural disasters. When traditional communication infrastructure fails, our system provides critical life-saving information through voice interaction, powered entirely by local processing using **Gemma 3n**.

### 🚨 The Problem We Solve

- **2.3 billion people** live in disaster-prone areas globally
- **65% of disaster victims** lose internet access within the first hour
- Existing emergency apps become **useless when you need them most**
- Visual interfaces fail in darkness, smoke, or when hands are injured

### ✨ Our Solution

A voice-first AI assistant that works **when everything else fails**:

```
🎤 Voice Input → 🧠 Local AI → 🔈 Spoken Guidance → 🚨 SOS Alert
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### 🚨 Medical Emergency
```
👤 User: "My friend fell and hit his head, he's bleeding and unconscious!"

🤖 Crisis-AI: "Emergency detected: head injury. Getting help now.
1. Do not move the person
2. Check if they're breathing
3. Apply gentle pressure to bleeding with clean cloth
4. Keep them warm and monitor breathing
5. SOS beacon activated - help is being requested"
```

### 🔥 Fire Emergency
```
👤 User: "Fire in the kitchen! Smoke everywhere!"

🤖 Crisis-AI: "Emergency detected: fire. 
1. Get out immediately - do not fight large fires
2. Stay low under smoke
3. Feel doors before opening - use back of hand
4. Close doors behind you
5. Call fire department once safely outside"
```

### 🌪️ Natural Disaster
```
👤 User: "Earthquake! Building is shaking!"

🤖 Crisis-AI: "Emergency detected: earthquake.
1. Drop to hands and knees immediately
2. Take cover under sturdy table or desk
3. Hold on and protect head and neck
4. Stay away from windows and heavy objects
5. Do not run outside during shaking"
```
