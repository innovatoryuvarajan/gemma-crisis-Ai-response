{"texts": ["National Disaster Words into Action Guidelines Governance System, Methodologies, and Use of Results Words into Action Guidelines National Disaster The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, which was adopted by the Member States of the United Nations in 2015, is designed to support the reduction of existing level of risks and prevent new risks from emerging. In particular, it aims at substantially reducing disaster risk and losses of life, livelihoods and health, and losses of economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities and The first priority for action of the Sendai Framework \u2013 understanding disaster risk \u2013 outlines a set of recommendations for ensuring that policies, measures and investments use risk information properly targeted towards", "reducing risk effectively. While the State has the primary role and responsibility in facilitating risk assessment and making risk information understandable and readily available to their peoples, the Sendai Framework also recognizes that all stakeholders and actors need to understand the risks they are exposed to and to be clear about the action they need to take to reduce those risks. Challenges still remain in using risk information in policy design, planning and investments. In order to find good approaches to addressing this issue and share existing knowledge in an accessible format, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) commissioned the development of guidelines on national disaster risk assessment as part of a series of thematic guidelines under", "its \u201cWords into Action\u201d initiative to support national implementation of the Sendai Framework. The Guidelines contribute to achieving the Sendai Framework target (g) on making disaster risk information available to people. They are also a testament to the great collaboration and partnerships among Member States and UNISDR technical partners in identifying good practices and sharing with others and so the Guidelines also contribute to achieving target (f) on enhancing international cooperation, by making good practice and know-how available to developing countries. Embedding disaster risk assessment and integrating it into the very culture of governance and daily work are key to empowering all actors with an improved understanding of disaster risk. The Guidelines recommend that States establish a national system for", "understanding disaster risk that should be integrated with related policy and planning mechanisms. The Guidelines attempt to make a contribution to the significant amount of work that is needed to develop tools and methods, to offer further guidance and to create partnerships to support countries in achieving this. UNISDR looks forward to continuing this work in collaboration with UN Member States and numerous partners in improving understanding of disaster risk and building a safer future.

A holistic risk assessment that considers all relevant hazards and vulnerabilities, both direct and indirect impacts, and a diagnosis of the sources of risk will support the design of policies and investments that are efficient and effective in reducing risk. During the decade of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015, substantial progress was made in advancing science and technology, developing tools for hazard and risk assessment, and producing risk information at different", "levels and scales across the world. Nevertheless, major gaps still exist in risk information quality and availability for various applications. And more importantly, the challenge remains for decision makers to use the available information in policy design and In the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, understanding disaster risk is the first priority for action: \u201cpolicies and practices for disaster risk management should be based on an understanding of disaster risk in all its dimensions of vulnerability, capacity, exposure of persons and assets, hazard characteristics and the environment.\u201d In 2016 the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) commissioned the development of guidelines on national disaster risk assessment (NDRA) as part of a series of thematic guidelines under", "its \u201cWords into Action\u201d initiative to support national implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. The present Guidelines are the result of the collaboration between over 100 leading experts from national authorities, international organizations, non- governmental organizations, academia, think tanks and private-sector entities. They focus on Sendai Framework\u2019s first Priority for Action: Understanding Disaster Risk, which is the basis for all measures on disaster risk reduction and is closely linked to the other three Priorities for Action. The Guidelines are intended to: a) Motivate and guide countries in establishing a national system for understanding disaster risk that would act as the central repository of all publicly available risk information. This national system would lead the implementation and", "updates of national disaster risk assessment for use in disaster risk management, including for risk-informed disaster risk reduction strategies and development plans; UNISDR, 2015. Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015 - 2030, The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, Geneva, Switzerland. b) Encourage disaster risk assessment leaders and implementing entities to aim for holistic assessments that would provide an understanding of the many different dimensions of disaster risk (hazards, exposures, vulnerabilities, capacities). The assessments would include diverse types of direct and indirect impacts of disaster \u2013 physical, social, economic, environmental and institutional. They would also provide information on the underlying drivers of risk \u2013 climate change, poverty, inequality, weak governance and unchecked urban expansion. Both of these outcomes", "may take many years and many iterations of the assessments, but as long as all the efforts have full national ownership by stakeholders and the scientific community and each update of the assessments is continuously improved, any country can achieve them. Although the Guidelines focus on national disaster risk assessment, many of the concepts they contain are relevant and applicable to subnational and sector-specific assessments. Figure i - Holistic understanding of disaster risk empowers effective and comprehensive disaster risk management (source: UNISDR) The target audience of the Guidelines are disaster risk management practitioners and risk assessment experts who want to design and implement a risk assessment at global, regional, national, or subnational level for use in policy and investment. Structure", "of the Guidelines The Guidelines are designed to allow freedom in reading various sections according to the interests and needs of the users. They consist of three parts: Part one - Main body This part focuses on the three stages of the assessment process. All elements of the three stages are closely connected through feedback loops and have some flexibility in sequencing and timing: Stage I: Preparing and scoping Stage II: Conducting risk analysis Stage III: Using the results for disaster risk management and development decisions. Part one provides policy guidance. Technical references for designing and implementing assessments are set out in parts two and three, as well as in footnotes and references. Figure ii Ten elements that enable success", "of a risk assessment are organized under three stages. The elements are interlinked and have some level of flexibility in sequencing and timing Part two - Special topics This part consists of modules on specific issues to be considered when designing and carrying out a national disaster risk assessment. Their relevance will depend on the country-specific context and national policy objectives. Each module can be read independently. Part three - Hazard specific risk assessment This part consists of modules covering more in-depth information on conducting risk assessment for specific hazards. The Sendai Framework calls for multi-hazard management of disaster risk based on understanding small- scale and large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters caused by natural or human-generated hazards,", "as well as related environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks. Part three is a work in progress, which will gradually cover more hazards and assessment Ten elements that enable a successful risk assessment at any level and are key for establishing a central system for understanding risk The ten elements that enable success of a risk assessment are organized under three stages of the risk assessment: (a) preparing and scoping, (b) conducting risk analysis and (c) using results for decisions in disaster risk management and sustainable development. These elements have been developed based on common characteristics that were identified among many successful risk assessments conducted at various levels, as well as a few national central systems for understanding disaster", "risk, including in Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland and the Stage I / Preparing and scoping This stage considers what needs to be done before embarking on an NDRA process, ensuring that outputs are fit for purpose. Five elements are introduced under this stage. Element 1 - Establishing a governance mechanism A successful NDRA requires a system of institutions, operational modalities, policies and a legal framework to guide, manage, coordinate and oversee implementation. It also requires consultations, engagement, ownership and contributions from a wide range of stakeholders. Establishing a strong governance mechanism is the foundation for a successful risk assessment. Element 1 describes the rationale, objectives, structure and considerations for modalities of operation of such a mechanism. Three main", "aspects of the governance mechanism are introduced here: (a) the governance structure, which includes the lead agency, the multi-stakeholder coordination body and the technical committee, (b) the legal framework and (c) the process agreements. Element 2 - Defining the policy scope and technical At the early stages of design, it is critical to be clear about the purpose and objectives of the risk assessment for producing relevant and usable information. Before conducting an NDRA, a feasibility study should be carried The study should define the policy scope, the technical scope and the boundaries set by the technical, financial and political resources available for the assessment. The scope will depend on the complexity and scale of a country and its risks.", "Element 2 provides an overview of the scoping process and issues for consideration to ensure the assessment is fit for purpose. Element 3 - Developing an NDRA data management Risk assessment is an extremely data-intensive process, and conducting a national risk assessment may involve accessing information from a wide range of stakeholders, including mapping agencies, scientific and technical ministries, universities, research institutions and the private sector. In addition, valuable new data and analyses are created during risk assessments. Therefore a strategy needs to be developed to efficiently organize and manage the data as they become available, as well as for distributing the results to participants and key stakeholders. Element 3 describes both the rationale for having an NDRA data management", "plan and the critical issues that need to be included. Element 4 - Developing required capacities The NDRA process requires strong administrative, technical and financial capacities. Administrative capacities refer to the legal and institutional frameworks within the country and how inclusive they are for a multi- stakeholder NDRA. Financial capacities refer to the availability of funds for completing the NDRA. Technical capacities refer to the type and level of technical expertise within the scientific community that are necessary for conducting risk analysis, as well as the technical capacities within the non-scientific community in understanding and using the results. Element 5 - Developing terms of reference for NDRA An NDRA is a project and needs to be managed as such. Its", "terms of reference guide the process and provide the basis for resource allocation. They should clearly indicate the timeline, milestones and deliverables, roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders, as well as the budget within which the process should be completed and results delivered. They need to be endorsed by the designated national authority/authorities and supported by adequate resource allocation. Element 5 describes the importance of developing comprehensive terms of reference to manage NDRA implementation and delivery. Stage II / Conducting risk analysis This stage is the analytical risk analysis performed by a technical team, based on the terms of reference. It covers three elements. Element 6 -Utilizing various risk analysis Many different and complementary methods and tools are available for", "analysing risk. These range from qualitative \u2013 based on the subjective perceptions of experts \u2013 to semi-quantitative and quantitative methods: probabilistic risk analysis, deterministic or scenario analysis, historical analysis and expert elicitation. Selecting the methods to use depends on the purpose the results should serve, the resources available and the significance of the risk. For effective disaster risk management, it is critical to have an understanding of risk from all hazards, interlinkages between hazards and vulnerabilities, and comparison of different types of risk. Although various methods and tools are available for single hazard assessment, methods for aggregation and comparison of hazards, and cascading and interrelated hazards and vulnerabilities are far more limited. Element 6 briefly describes various risk analysis methodologies,", "risk comparison techniques and considerations for selecting the most suitable Element 7 - Key considerations in conducting risk This element describes key considerations in conducting a risk analysis, such as: (a) identifying and compiling existing input data, (b) assessing disaster risk management capacities and (c) determining the sources and drivers of risk, the direct and indirect impacts and the climate change impact. Element 8 - Preparing the outputs of risk analysis for communication with stakeholders Presenting the results in a format that is understandable, relevant and useful to the stakeholders is key to the success of an NDRA. Element 8 emphasizes the importance of using a variety of tools and methods such as geospatial tools and mapping, risk matrices, scenarios,", "loss exceedance curves, visuals and infographics to prepare the outputs of the analysis for communication and use by stakeholders for the purposes of the NDRA. Stage III / Using NDRA results for disaster risk management and development decisions Element 9 - Facilitating the process for evaluation and applying results in disaster risk management decisions The outputs of risk assessment are inputs to decision-making on plans, actions and investments for managing disaster risk. Element 9 provides an overview of the necessary re-engagement between the technical team and the stakeholders to understand the NDRA results, evaluating the risks so as to prioritize them and applying the assessment to the original policy scope defined at the scoping and preparation stage. This dialogue may", "lead to demand for further analysis to gain additional perspectives, such as greater understanding of the risk drivers, or the impact of certain disaster risk management policies or cost-benefit analysis of specific This step is by no means the end of disaster risk management or disaster management planning but simply an opportunity to evaluate options while interacting with the technical teams who conducted the national assessment. At the end of this step, the final set of risk assessment outputs \u2013 as data sets, maps, reports or any other formats, customized for the stakeholders \u2013 is delivered to the NDRA lead agency, and this cycle of NDRA comes to an end. Element 10 - Ensuring long-term sustainability of The vision of", "the Sendai Framework\u2019s first priority for action, understanding disaster risk, and the approach presented in these Guidelines, is to have in every country a well-established central system for understanding disaster risk. The system should produce the risk information needed for prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery, in order to build a resilient With a multi-stakeholder governance system, the central system updates the NDRA every few years, conducts specific risk assessment on demand and maintains the national clearinghouse of risk data and information. Element 10 describes the recommended long-term plan for the country NDRA system. Conclusions and the way forward The Sendai Framework calls for strong political leadership, commitment and involvement of all stakeholders, at all levels, to pursue the goal", "of preventing new and reducing existing disaster risk: \u201cthrough the implementation of integrated and inclusive economic, structural, legal, social, health, cultural, educational, environmental, technological, political and institutional measures that prevent and reduce hazard exposure and vulnerability to disaster, increase preparedness for response and recovery, and thus strengthen Such a complex task requires novel approaches and methods, and perhaps most importantly, new mindsets. Building resilience is largely a cross-cutting theme and starts from understanding disaster risk. An NDRA can bring multiple sectors and stakeholders together to understand the risk and causes of risk from various hazards and vulnerabilities. A successful NDRA, embedded in development and DRR policy and planning, can be the foundation for successful disaster risk management \u2013 ranging from", "prevention and reduction to preparedness, response and recovery. These Guidelines are a step forward in motivating countries to (a) establish national systems for understanding disaster risk to conduct risk assessments that they can integrate into their policy and planning mechanisms and (b) take a holistic approach to understanding the complexity of all dimensions of risk, including various hazards and vulnerabilities, direct and indirect impact \u2013 and most importantly, the sources and causes of risks. Chapter 1. Background About the Guidelines In 2016 the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) commissioned the development of guidelines on national disaster risk assessment (NDRA) as part of a series of thematic guidelines under its \u201cWords into Action\u201d initiative to support national implementation", "of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030.

They provide an overview of policy objectives, effective governance, processes of design, implementation and use of assessment results in comprehensive disaster risk management. They are based on the premise that any national disaster risk assessment needs to consider intensive and extensive risks, and that disaster risk management needs", "to be correlated with sustainable development and the effects of climate change The Guidelines are structured in three parts. The first part focuses on important elements in the NDRA process: preparation and scoping, implementation and use of results. The second part consists of modules on specific issues that should be considered depending on the objective and scope of the assessment. The third part covers more in-depth information on conducting risk assessment for various hazards. Although the Guidelines focus on national disaster risk assessment, many of the concepts presented are relevant and applicable for subnational or sector- specific assessments. Natural climate variability and human-generated climate change influence the frequency, intensity, spatial extent and duration of some extreme weather and climate events.", "The vulnerability of exposed human society and ecosystems interacts with these events to determine impacts and the likelihood of disasters (IPCC, 2012). Besides natural hazards, climate change can also lead to change in exposure, for example in the case of climate refugees as a result of sea- level rise and draught. IPCC, 2012.

Understanding Disaster Risk is a requirement for achieving Sustainable Development Goals \u2022 The 2030 Agenda for", "Sustainable Development outlines a vision for people, planet, prosperity and peace with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Risk and resilience are at the heart of planning for achieving SDGs, because: shocks and stresses can reverse years of efforts and investments in development achievements \u2022 many of the SDGs are focused on issues that are underlying drivers of risk, for example: poverty and inequality, climate change, lack of peace, or weak institutions. Achieving these goals would lead to risk reduction. \u2022 bad \u2018development\u2019 can be a source of risk for example: unregulated urban development or construction of vulnerable critical infrastructures. Using holistic approach in understanding risk and applying it in development plans and investments ensure long term resilience of societies.", "The Guidelines are based on a detailed review of the methodologies, approaches and governance mechanisms practised in national disaster risk assessment across the globe, as well as on existing guidelines. The selection of an approach for conducting the assessments takes account of a wide range of issues including the purpose of NDRA, available capacities and resources, quality of the available data, political will and engagement of the stakeholders and sectoral priorities. The design of the Guidelines permits the sharing of the findings from studying the most effective existing assessments. It also addresses the expected variability by offering information on a wide range of topics and hazards to be adapted to different national contexts. With the objective of understanding the roots", "of the existing gap between the production of risk information and its actual use in decision-making in disaster risk management, the team working on the Guidelines held consultations both with national policy institutions and with technical experts. They did this to ensure that the recommended approach would be based on understanding both the policy and technical aspects of NDRA and use of the assessment in decision-making. The Guidelines advocate for an \u201call-of-government\u201d and \u201call-of-society\u201d approach for NDRA to ensure its legitimacy, comprehensiveness and effectiveness. This is an imperative given the multifaceted character of disaster risk, its causes and its need for interlinked action at all government levels, and across sectors and communities. The Guidelines, therefore, address the following entities: Policymakers", "concerned with setting disaster risk management and sustainable development policy priorities and planning instruments across the entire public administration system at national and subnational levels. National, subnational and local practitioners of disaster risk management who will use the outputs from the assessment to guide the design and implementation of disaster risk management measures. Disaster risk management practitioners at regional and global development institutions financing or providing technical support to developing countries for conducting national risk assessments. Technical experts from a wide range of thematic specializations (e.g. hydrometeorology, geophysics, sustainable development, climate change, public health, engineering, social protection, anthropology) who are involved in providing risk information for use in policy decisions. Academia and centres of research and knowledge creation that have", "a major role to play in providing a solid scientific basis for disaster risk Civil society representatives concerned with various aspects of building societal resilience at national and local levels or in a specific sector. The private sector \u2013 a key actor for reducing losses, prioritizing risk- proofed investments and the economic resilience of disaster-prone communities, as well as for providing data, methodologies and tools for How to read the Guidelines The Guidelines are designed to allow freedom in reading various sections according to the interests and needs of the users. They consist of three main Part one - Main body (the present document) This part focuses on the three stages of the assessment process. All elements of the three", "stages are closely connected through common issues to be addressed and feedback loops: Stage I: Preparing and scoping Stage II: Conducting risk analysis Stage III: Using the results for disaster risk management and development decisions. Part one provides policy guidance. Technical references for designing and implementing assessments are set out in technical modules in parts two and three, as well as in footnotes and references. Part two - Special topics This part consists of modules on specific issues to be considered when designing and carrying out a national disaster risk assessment. Their relevance will depend on the country-specific context and national policy objectives. Each module can be read independently. The topics addre ssed include the following: Risk communication Direct and", "indirect economic impacts Citizen participation Cost benefit analysis Benefits of probabilistic modelling Use of geographic information system Cross border issues Groups with vulnerabilities Use of the assessment for risk financing.. Part three - Hazard specific risk assessment This part consists of modules covering more in-depth information on conducting risk assessment for specific hazards . The Sendai Framework calls for multi-hazard management of disaster risk based on understanding small- scale and large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters caused by natural or human-generated hazards, as well as related environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks. Part three is a work in progress and in the coming years will gradually cover more hazards and assessment methods. The technical modules give an", "overview of concepts, methodologies and tools related to each special topic and hazard. They are aimed at an audience that understands risk assessment but is not expert in the topic. Each module offers resources and links to further information and guidance. For the interim version of the Guidelines, released in May 2017, parts two and three have not gone through editing to harmonize the writing style. This will be done for the final version. Introduction to national disaster risk assessment Rationale for investing in national disaster risk Recent disasters dramatically affected millions of people, with hundreds of thousands of lives and US$ 1.5 trillion lost between 2005 and 2014 alone, a tenfold increase over the previous decade. Global economic loss", "from disasters varies on average from US$ 250 billion to US$ 300 billion each year . This value is an underestimate as it only covers direct physical losses from five hazards. Figure 1 gives an overview of risk levels from only five hazards across the world. It is also important to note that loss values may not be too high in least developed countries but the impact of such losses would be significant for such fragile economies with weak social safety measures.

Investing in understanding disaster risk is therefore more important than ever if we want to understand its complexity and efficiently manage the resources required for managing disaster risk and designing interventions. The Sendai Framework reinforces the crucial shift made in Yokohama and Hyogo from managing disasters to managing disaster risk, while resilience- building has grown into a shared ground for all international agreements made under the 2030 Agenda. Coherence and linkages between the implementation of the Sendai Framework, the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement on climate change, the outcomes of the World Humanitarian Summit and the New Urban Agenda, and allied sectoral agreements such as the International Health Regulations (2005) are critical to ensure risk-informed development", "and resilience-building. Resilience has been defined as: \u201cThe ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate, adapt to, transform and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including through the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions through risk management\u201d.

National disaster risk assessments are costly exercises but the long-term benefits of risk-informed disaster risk reduction significantly outweigh the initial costs of the assessment. For most of the risk management measures that would benefit from a risk assessment, the financial cost of conducting an assessment is marginal in relation to the total cost of the investment. Implementing national assessments, giving due consideration to the impact of climate change and to the correlation of disaster risk", "management with sustainable development creates a purposeful platform for communication and collaboration among stakeholders in disaster risk management, climate change adaptation and development, who, in many countries, are operating in silos. The approach to assessing and managing risks of different hazards and in different sectors (e.g. in relation to diseases) often occurs in isolation. Multi-hazard assessments help bring these actors together to study the relative risks of each type of hazard and find common ground for taking effective measures and using resources efficiently through an \u201call-hazards\u201d Rationale for the approach presented in the A review of the achievement of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 in risk identification and national disaster risk assessments has identified critical requirements for successful assessments,", "providing useful information for disaster risk reduction decision-making and practice. The review revealed that for an assessment to be successful, it needs the following: Inclusive governance mechanism Broad set of technical, financial, and administrative capacities Availability of reliable data and a solid methodology that meet the intended use of risk assessment results Political will to ensure that the outcomes are accessible, understandable and usable for the intended disaster risk management purposes. The approach presented in these Guidelines ensures that the following requirements for the success of an assessment are covered: NDRA governance mechanism: It is critical to ensure that the governance mechanism is well embedded in the disaster risk management governance mechanism and is inclusive. It should involve various sectoral", "ministerial portfolios, the national science and technology communities, the private sector and civil society. While national disaster risk assessment governance is primarily concerned with the assessment process itself, the national disaster risk management governance has a broader scope, including the design and implementation of disaster risk reduction strategies and enabling systematic integration of disaster risk considerations into development planning. Purpose, methodology and outputs: Clarity on the purpose of the risk assessment is needed to develop the scope, select the methodologies and tools, and the format of the outcomes. The methodology selected will define the sensitivity and robustness of the outcomes. While methods can vary significantly, it is essential to define the limitations of the chosen methodology to avoid false perception", "of precision, and define the confidence levels and uncertainties as well as the role of risk perception and risk acceptance that inevitably affects the decisions. For example, historical loss databases, which may cover data from few decades of disaster events, are excellent method for measuring impacts from high frequency and low impact events such as small floods. However, they can give false perception by masking less frequent floods with catastrophic impacts, which may not have happened in the past few decades but may happen in the future. Historical loss databases are not appropriate for assessing intensive events. Capacities for conducting NDRA: This refers to the technical, financial and administrative capacities required for effective implementation. An NDRA is often a complex", "and resource-intensive undertaking. Its scope is a trade-off between the full scientific depth of the assessment and the time and human resources that can be devoted to carrying it out while meeting the objective of using the assessment in disaster risk Data management: Availability of data is critical for a sufficiently grounded assessment. The assessment is made on the basis of validated sources of information and data on hazards, exposure, vulnerabilities and coping capacities. It might also be necessary to improve the existing data UNWCDRR, 2015. Risk Identification and Assessment (Priority 2) Multi-Stakeholder Working Session, United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, Sendai, Japan. on hazard, exposure, vulnerability and capacities, as well as historical disaster loss data, the ongoing", "collection and recording of losses and damages, and the data management systems for NDRA. Political commitment: Political endorsement, leadership and the support of a high-level national authority, and ownership and commitment from all stakeholders are required to provide the necessary input data, understand the results and their limitations, and use the results in disaster risk management decision-making. The first part of the Guidelines presents 10 enabling elements for designing and implementing an assessment, clustered in three stages. The elements are interlinked through many common topics for attention and feedback loops. Figure 2 - Ten enabling elements in three stages of the NDRA process, interlinked through overlapping areas of concern and feedback loops Understanding disaster risk components Over time the conceptualization", "of disaster risk has undergone a transformation. These Guidelines use the classic disaster risk concept, which describes risk in terms of likelihood and impact, based on the interaction between hazard, exposure, vulnerabilities and capacities. To identify and evaluate the best measures for reducing risk, an assessment should also explain the underlying drivers of hazard, exposure, vulnerabilities and capacities, as well as the direct and indirect impacts. Below are the definitions of these components from the Open-ended Intergovernmental Expert Working Group (OIEWG) report to the General Assembly on Indicators and Terminology, 2016. Disaster risk: The potential loss of life, injury, or destroyed or damaged assets which could occur to a system, society or a community in a specific period of time,", "determined probabilistically as a function of hazard, exposure, vulnerability and capacity. The definition of disaster risk reflects the concept of hazardous events and disasters as the outcome of continuously present conditions of risk. Disaster risk comprises different types of potential losses which are often difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, with knowledge of the prevailing hazards and the patterns of population and socioeconomic development, disaster risks can be assessed and mapped, in broad terms at least. It is important to consider the social and economic contexts in which disaster risks occur and that people do not necessarily share the same perceptions of risk and their underlying risk Acceptable risk, or tolerable risk, is therefore an important subterm; the extent to which a", "disaster risk is deemed acceptable or tolerable depends on existing social, economic, political, cultural, technical and environmental conditions. In engineering terms, acceptable risk is also used to assess and define the structural and non-structural measures that are needed in order to reduce possible harm to people, property, services and systems to a chosen tolerated level, according to codes or \u201caccepted practice\u201d which are based on known probabilities of hazards and other factors. Residual risk is the disaster risk that remains even when effective disaster risk reduction measures are in place, and for which emergency response and recovery capacities must be maintained. The presence of residual risk implies a continuing need to develop and support effective capacities for emergency services, preparedness,", "response and recovery, together with socioeconomic policies such as safety nets and risk transfer mechanisms, as part of a holistic approach. National Disaster Risk: intensive and extensive Disaster Risks that either have a potential (cumulative) impact that is significant and relevant for the nation as a whole and/or require national DRM coordination. Annotation: the boundaries of National Disaster Risk depend on the purpose and scoping of a NDRA process. This has to be defined in each country, taking into account existing governance and DRM policies. National Disaster Risks at least include all risks that cannot be sufficiently managed at sub-national level. Extensive Disaster Risk: the risk associated with low-severity, high-frequency events, mainly but not exclusively associated with highly localized hazards.", "Intensive Disaster Risk: the risk associated with high-severity, mid to low-frequency events, mainly associated with major hazards. Open-ended Intergovernmental Expert Working Group (OIEWG) report to the General Assembly on Indicators and Terminology, Disaster risk assessment: A qualitative or quantitative approach to determine the nature and extent of disaster risk by analysing potential hazards and evaluating existing conditions of exposure and vulnerability that together could harm people, property, services, livelihoods and the environment on which they depend. Disaster risk assessments include: the identification of hazards; a review of the technical characteristics of hazards such as their location, intensity, frequency and probability; the analysis of exposure and vulnerability, including the physical, social, health, environmental and economic dimensions; and the evaluation of the", "effectiveness of prevailing and alternative coping capacities with respect to likely risk Hazard: A process, phenomenon or human activity that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. Hazards may be natural, anthropogenic or socio-natural in origin. Natural hazards are predominantly associated with natural processes and phenomena. Anthropogenic hazards, or human-induced hazards, are induced entirely or predominantly by human activities and choices. This term does not include the occurrence or risk of armed conflicts and other situations of social instability or tension which are subject to international humanitarian law and national legislation. Several hazards are socio-natural, in that they are associated with a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors,", "including environmental degradation and climate change. Hazards may be single, sequential or combined in their origin and effects. Each hazard is characterized by its location, intensity or magnitude, frequency and probability. Biological hazards are also defined by their infectiousness or toxicity, or other characteristics of the pathogen such as dose-response, incubation period, case fatality rate and estimation of the pathogen for transmission. Multi-hazard means (1) the selection of multiple major hazards that the country faces, and11 (2) the specific contexts where hazardous events may occur simultaneously, in a cascading manner or cumulatively over time, and taking into account the potential interrelated effects. Hazards include (as mentioned in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, and listed in alphabetical order)", "biological, environmental, geological, hydro- meteorological and technological processes and phenomena. Exposure: The situation of people, infrastructure, housing, production capacities and other tangible human assets located in hazard-prone areas. Measures of exposure can include the number of people or types of assets in an area. These can be combined with the specific vulnerability and capacity of the exposed elements to any particular hazard to estimate the quantitative risks associated with that hazard in the area of Vulnerability: The conditions determined by physical, social, economic and environmental factors or processes which increase the susceptibility of an individual, a community, assets or systems to the impacts of hazards Open-ended Intergovernmental Expert Working Group (OIEWG) report to the General Assembly on Indicators and Terminology,", "10 In these Guidelines, assessment of coping capacity, underlying drivers of risk, direct and indirect impact are part of understanding disaster risk 11 While OIEWG defined it with \u201cand\u201d, in understanding of many experts contributing to this guideline the definition should use \u201cor\u201d Capacity: The combination of all the strengths, attributes and resources available within an organization, community or society to manage and reduce disaster risks and strengthen resilience. Capacity may include infrastructure, institutions, human knowledge and skills, and collective attributes such as social relationships, leadership and management. Coping capacity is the ability of people, organizations and systems, using available skills and resources, to manage adverse conditions, risk or disasters. The capacity to cope requires continuing awareness, resources and good", "management, both in normal times as well as during disasters or adverse conditions. Coping capacities contribute to the reduction of disaster risks. Underlying disaster risk drivers: Processes or conditions, often development-related, that influence the level of disaster risk by increasing levels of exposure and vulnerability or reducing capacity. Underlying disaster risk drivers \u2014 also referred to as underlying disaster risk factors \u2014 include poverty and inequality, climate change and variability, unplanned and rapid urbanization and the lack of disaster risk considerations in land management and environmental and natural resource management, as well as compounding factors such as demographic change, non- disaster risk-informed policies, the lack of regulations and incentives for private disaster risk reduction investment, complex supply chains, the limited", "availability of technology, unsustainable uses of natural resources, declining ecosystems, pandemics and epidemics. Figure 3 - Underlying drivers may influence more than one component of disaster risk Open-ended Intergovernmental Expert Working Group (OIEWG) report to the General Assembly on Indicators and Terminology, Disaster impact: is the total effect, including negative effects (e.g., economic losses) and positive effects (e.g., economic gains), of a hazardous event or a disaster. The term includes economic, human and environmental impacts, and may include death, injuries, disease and other negative effects on human physical, mental and social well-being. Economic loss: Total economic impact that consists of direct economic loss and indirect Direct economic loss: the monetary value of total or partial destruction of physical assets existing", "in the affected area. Direct economic loss is nearly equivalent to physical damage. Indirect economic loss: a decline in economic value added as a consequence of direct economic loss and/or human and environmental impacts. Indirect economic loss includes microeconomic impacts (e.g., revenue declines owing to business interruption), meso- economic impacts (e.g., revenue declines owing to impacts on natural assets, interruptions to supply chains or temporary unemployment) and macroeconomic impacts (e.g., price increases, increases in government debt, negative impact on stock market prices and decline in GDP). Indirect losses can occur inside or outside of the hazard area and often have a time lag. As a result they may be intangible or difficult to measure. Figure 4 - There are direct", "and indirect impacts of disasters. Not all types of impact can easily be quantified in monetary terms Open-ended Intergovernmental Expert Working Group (OIEWG) report to the General Assembly on Indicators and Terminology, Hazard, exposure, vulnerabilities and capacities are dynamic and constantly changing as a result of changes, for instance, in land use and land cover, rapidly growing urbanization, construction practice and regulations and technological innovations. Other processes further impact the dynamics of hazard, exposure, vulnerability, capacity and their interactions, including underlying root causes such as climate change, population growth or changing demographic structures, and changing levels of inequality gaps and poverty. Therefore, understanding (through NDRA) and addressing (through disaster risk management) the root causes of all dimensions of risk is", "an essential Figure 5 - Holistic understanding of disaster risk empowers effective and comprehensive disaster risk management Process of national disaster risk assessment The risk assessment process flow outlined in the international standards on risk management (ISO 31000:2009) and on risk assessment (31010:2009) is the most commonly used . It starts with setting the context and then consists of three steps: risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation. This process flow is the basis for most European assessments and for the Australian national risk assessment guidelines and some others. Below is a description of each component of the process, cross-referencing the elements in the Guidelines that cover that step. Establishing context: This step is concerned with understanding the risk management", "context in order to define the purpose and scope of the risk assessment. It includes engaging and consulting with stakeholders and defining criteria for decisions. In the Guidelines, establishing context starts in element 1 and is then completed with policy and technical scoping in element 2. Risk identification: From a national disaster risk assessment perspective, this step is concerned with a very high-level scoping of hazard, exposure and vulnerabilities to define the direction for the rest of the assessment process. It uses the knowledge and experience of stakeholders, data on past disasters and risk information to draw initial conclusions about the importance of a specific hazard, assets, known vulnerabilities and major impacts of concern for an NDRA. Consideration should be", "given to both extensive (frequent, low- impact) and intensive (occasional, high-impact) events, as well as potential Updated version of ISO 31000 and 310310 due for release in 2019. Box 2. Severity of disaster impact depends on exposure, vulnerability and coping capacity In October 2016, hurricane Matthew caused severe devastation across the eastern Caribbean and south-eastern US claiming hundreds of lives. The level of impact varied significantly among different countries that were in the path of Matthew. This variation was due to intensity and path of the storm, area of landfall as well as the level of exposure, vulnerabilities, and coping capacity specially the capacity to evacuate people. In Cuba, more than 1million people were forced to evacuate before the storm", "arrives and there was no casualty. However, in Haiti where the hurricane had similar intensity, 175,500 people evacuated and around 550 people were killed. Six months later hundreds of thousands of displaced people were still living in shelters. In order to fully understand the potential impact from Hurricanes in these countries, the assessment should include socio-economic vulnerabilities, administrative and financial capacities, and longer term indirect impact of population displacement and infrastructure damage among other components of disaster risk.

In the Guidelines, disaster risk identification starts in element 2 and is then completed with", "more technical depth in element 6. Risk analysis: This step is concerned with obtaining a more detailed understanding of the disaster risk: detailed hazard analysis, exposure analysis, vulnerability analysis and capacity analysis. The analysis provides insight into the interaction of a single hazard or a multi-hazard with the exposure and all dimensions of vulnerabilities (physical, environmental, social, economic and cultural). Each point of interaction of disaster risk components creates a unique coupling: a specific impact and its likelihood. Another component of risk analysis is understanding and evaluating the effectiveness of the existing capacities (or the controls and measures in place for managing the risk, as this is called in ISO:31010). Understanding the effectiveness of capacities is critical for identifying targeted", "measures to manage the risk. Risk analysis also includes assessing the confidence level or the level of uncertainty. This is relevant for both single-hazard and multi-hazard disaster risk analysis, with any time-horizon. Risk analysis is covered in elements 6 Risk evaluation: This step allows for risk prioritization for the purpose of managing the risk. The multi-hazard disaster risks analysed for likelihood and impact could be presented in different ways to facilitate the visualization and prioritization process. The risk prioritization is further adjusted based on an understanding of capacities, risk perception and risk acceptance of the whole of a country\u2019s society, and by the availability and level of resources to manage the risks. This requires input from those owning the risk", "and who are responsible for disaster risk management. The whole of society is represented through stakeholder coordination and communication mechanisms to define the priority disaster risks. Only then is there a legitimate basis for disaster risk prioritization \u2013 defining the risks of high societal importance that require immediate attention, the risks that could be tolerated or neglected, and the risks that need to be closely monitored. Risk evaluation is covered in elements 8 and 9. Instead of considering risk perception and acceptance as part of the risk evaluation, another option is to perform an additional \u201csocietal risk assessment\u201d to analyse societal risk considerations, as suggested by the International Risk Governance Council.

Implementing a national disaster risk assessment This chapter describes in detail each of the three stages of the assessment: preparing and scoping, conducting risk analysis and using the results for decisions in disaster risk management and sustainable development. Stage I covers the first five elements, stage II covers the next two and stage III the The elements reflect the logic", "of each stage, but many are interlinked. All the elements should be read in order to obtain a complete picture and better understand how they can enable a country to implement an effective NDRA process for producing information for use in disaster risk management. Stage I Preparing and scoping This stage considers what needs to be done before embarking on an NDRA process, ensuring that outputs are fit for purpose. It explains the importance of identifying the key stakeholders and shaping viable governance mechanisms for NDRA, including roles and responsibilities, defining the thematic scope of the assessment, agreeing on a data management plan, and assessing the technical capacities necessary for successful implementation of the NDRA and, if necessary, developing those", "capacities. The final product of this preparatory stage is the terms of reference to initiate the assessment process. The elements below detail each of these components. Element 1 - Establishing a governance mechanism This element describes the rationale, objectives, structure and considerations for modalities of operation of an NDRA governance mechanism. Why a governance mechanism is needed? The rationale for establishing a governance mechanism is based on the a) An effective NDRA requires consultations, engagement and contributions from a wide range of stakeholders: governmental bodies including line ministries; civil defence; the private sector; civil society; the scientific community and the general public. Many of these groups are owners of risk and in positions to manage that risk. As each has", "a different and often conflicting understanding of disaster risk, they communicate disaster risk information differently, have different institutional and legal requirements, and different levels of financial resources to engage with a national disaster risk b) A successful NDRA requires a system of institutions, operational modalities, policies and a legal framework to guide, manage, coordinate and oversee implementation. The principles of good governance \u2013 inclusiveness, transparency, accountability, efficiency and responsiveness \u2013 guide the implementation process. This is of particular interest, as the outcomes of an NDRA might in some cases show levels of risk that are not politically palatable and would therefore need a transparent and accountable risk evaluation. To function effectively, the NDRA governance structure requires: Clarity and agreement on", "the division of the roles and responsibilities of each involved actor Political legitimacy or mandate Adequate resources. Obtaining long-term political commitment for a national disaster risk assessment is of great importance, because the assessment informs strategic decisions on risk management that require long-term political and financial commitment for their implementation. Besides, the assessment itself is an iterative process that can stretch across a political term of office and requires long-term sustainability. Such a governance mechanism is defined based on the high-level objective of NDRA. For example, an assessment that is only supposed to provide inputs for national emergency preparedness and planning may have a different lead agency from an assessment that is meant to provide hazard and risk information for", "a comprehensive disaster risk reduction strategy, sustainable development planning or climate change adaptation. Governance structure While the context of NDRA governance is directly guided by the high-level objective of the assessment, and it can differ from country to country, there is also an emerging overall pattern of NDRA governance mechanisms defining roles and responsibilities of various entities: Lead agency: The lead agency, which coordinates and oversees the whole process and acts as the secretariat for the national disaster risk assessment, could be any of the following: National civil protection agency/national disaster risk reduction For example, high-risk levels that could trigger concerns of scaring off investment, or low-risk levels that could limit chances of donor investment in disaster risk management projects.", "Environmental protection agency Ministry of Internal Affairs Ministry of Planning and Development Agency with a broad mandate related to disaster risk management Office of the Prime Minister. Multi-stakeholder coordination body: Implementation of the national disaster risk assessment is carried out by a specially established coordination body that includes a variety of stakeholders (as the risk owners) and other actors who will use the outputs of the assessment for their disaster risk management measures. It is essential to include in this body stakeholders from the public and the private sector, from entities working on development planning and climate change adaptation, from civil society and the media, from national and sub-national levels, and general public representatives. If possible, it is best to", "give governance of the assessment to an existing intergovernmental coordination structure. This reduces the overheads and ensures long-term sustainability. The existing mechanism should be enhanced with the right technical entities and if needed other relevant stakeholders to ensure coverage of the full scope of the national disaster risk assessment. A variety of mechanisms and tools could be used for consultations, communication and collaboration depending on the objective. These could include in-person multi-stakeholder meetings and workshops, questionnaires, online collaboration platforms, social media and geospatial Technical committee: A multisectoral technical committee provides scientific advice throughout the process, secures sufficient contributions from experts, and ensures an adequate level of scientific quality of the risk assessment. This committee has to ensure cooperation on the", "interface between science and policy. It should consist of a group of recognized experts with diverse backgrounds who understand both the technical and the policy implications of national risk assessments and how they are used in disaster risk management. Importantly, the technical committee should be of such a size and structure to allow access to a wide network of experts to quickly mobilize the expertise and advice required on specific technical matters. It may be necessary to set up additional thematic subcommittees on themes related to hazards, exposure, susceptibility, capacity, or cross-cutting themes. The technical committee might also decide to create subcommittees focusing on specific hazards. In the absence of the necessary expertise \u2013 for example, for conducting probabilistic risk", "modelling \u2013 a country should mobilize the capacities of the international scientific community. Whatever governance model is chosen, it should be suitable for implementing every step of the assessment from beginning to end, including: Identifying and engaging stakeholders Undertaking quality control Holding multi-stakeholder consultations Defining needed capacities Defining the methodology Identifying data management requirements Overseeing delivery of outputs. Box 3 - Expert Advisory Council role in Georgia In Georgia the involvement of science is enshrined in legislation. According to the Law on Public Safety, \u2018within the scope of the emergency risk reduction strategy, a national public consultative body \u2014 the Expert Advisory Council \u2014 is established under the Emergency Management Agency\u2019.

Ideally, such political endorsement could be further formalized by a regulatory act prescribing the roles and responsibilities of the various institutions and the decision process concerning the outputs of the assessment.

Element 2 - Defining the policy scope and technical scope of NDRA The objective of this element, scoping of NDRA, is to ensure NDRA is designed and implemented to be \u201cfit for purpose\u201d. Before conducting a national disaster risk assessment, it is important to conduct a feasibility study. The study should define the policy scope, the technical scope and the boundaries set by the technical, financial and political resources available for the assessment. The scope of the assessment will depend on the complexity and scale of a country and its risks. The \u201cpolicy scoping\u201d is based on national disaster risk management policy objectives for preventing the creation of", "new risk, reducing existing risk, managing residual risk and developing resilience. Policy scoping may start with a political discussion at the higher level of government, such as a council of ministers, and then be continued by consultation with the stakeholders represented in the governance mechanism. The \u201ctechnical scoping\u201d translates the policy scope into elements of disaster risk assessment (hazard, exposure, vulnerability and capacity), as well as the time-horizon for considering risk levels and the time cycle for updating the The main mechanism for defining the scope is consultation with the stakeholders and users.

Disaster risk information: In every country, some level of information is already available on hazard and disaster risk.

The targets and indicators cover a wide range of impacts, such as: Number of people injured or illness attributed to disaster Number of people whose dwellings were damaged or destroyed Number of people displaced Direct loss of economic, agricultural and other productive assets, housing sector, or cultural heritage Disruption to critical infrastructure or basic services, health services, etc. management should", "also be considered to see how those (or similar ones in the future) could be risk-informed by the assessment. Some questions are listed below as examples of the range of issues to be considered in relation to the national disaster risk assessment: What kind of policy decisions will it inform, and how? Will it serve the national disaster risk reduction strategy? Will it serve climate change adaptation planning? Will it serve national development planning? Will it serve national business, sectoral or community resilience Is it focused on emergency preparedness and on saving lives, or will it serve holistic risk management planning to inform prevention, preparedness, response and recovery planning and practice? Will it inform high-level disaster risk management investment planning", "or decisions on investing in risk reduction of key infrastructure? If so, which infrastructure for which hazards should it cover? And should it identify the most vulnerable infrastructure or just the most vulnerable sector as the basis for further assessment? Will it form the basis for disaster risk financing and insurance? Will it provide the basis for updating building codes? Will it serve as the basis for financial support to subnational governments to invest in disaster risk reduction? Will it provide insights on vulnerability of most common construction Will it provide risk data disaggregated for low-income and vulnerable groups including women and children? National versus nationwide: Does the \u201cN\u201d in NDRA mean that the assessment has to inform disaster risk", "management decisions for the whole country, or is it limited to risks that are \u201cof national importance (i.e. that the actual event would require national coordination)? If the latter is the case, the governance structure should delegate the separate assessment of non-national risks to the appropriate government level and Current NDRA status: The scope of the assessment might vary according to the status of existing national, subnational and sectoral risk assessments, as well as the current status and potential of a country\u2019s science/policy interface. If nothing exists, neither sectoral nor subnational risk assessments, the scope of a \u201cfirst run of NDRA\u201d might be limited to the main hazards that are most obvious from the experience of the stakeholders or from", "international information like the index for risk management (INFORM) or global/regional risk profiling conducted by international agencies. Alternatively, if sectoral assessments have already been completed, the scope should be as broad as possible and include existing work (where practical, and as long as it fits the NDRA objectives). National versus local and sectoral disaster risk assessment: An NDRA targets risks of national significance. This will also include disaster risks that only manifest themselves at provincial or community level, or in specific sectors. There is significant evidence of good practices across the globe of successful community-based disaster risk assessments. Careful balancing of bottom-up with top-down approaches in disaster risk assessment and establishing stronger linkages between the national assessment and local-level, community-level", "and sectoral disaster risk assessment practices could enrich both processes. A national risk assessment can provide a wealth of data and information for subnational and sectoral use. Examples include: Use in advocacy and awareness at the local/sectoral level Use for scoping step local/sectoral risk assessments Using hazard, exposure, vulnerability and capacity datasets as a starting point for developing higher resolution/local risk assessments Access to national and international technical experts Standardization of subnational and sectoral disaster risk information to enable local and cross-sectoral interconnections. This depends on the governance system of a country. In some countries the responsibilities for disaster risk management (even for national disaster risks) are strongly decentralized, while in other countries the subnational level has no mandate whatsoever", "regarding national disaster risks. Furthermore, the level of autonomy of self-governing subnational bodies (e.g. federal States) can set limitations for a top-down approach to NDRA. Box 8- Fragmentary reports in Poland In Poland ministries, national agencies and provinces are by law obliged to contribute to NDRA. Each sector and each province has to develop a so-called \u2018fragmentary report\u2019, according to the same national risk assessment methodology. In turn, the provinces ask for input from the municipalities. The national coordinating entity (the Government Centre for Security) gives feedback on all fragmentary reports, identifies gaps and connections and combines them into one overall \u2018Report on Threats to National Security\u2019 for the Council of Ministers. This kind of mechanism ensures that all sectors", "are involved in the NDRA process. The two-way risk-assessment process, from local, to provincial, to NDRA (and the feedback loop from national to provincial level) builds a strong decentralized information basis for NDRA, as well as a basis for the coordination of prevention strategies. Source: EU Peer Review Poland, Risk Management Capacities, 2016http://ec.europa.eu/echo/ sites/echo-site/files/poland_peer_review_report_-_en.pdf At the same time, representatives at the local and sectoral level can contribute with datasets that are available only to them (e.g. data on assets that are critical at local level). Arguably, NDRA could be a macro-level aggregation of subnational and sectoral risk assessments, so long as the interoperability of the methodologies is ensured. However, this will not always be reachable or optimal. In some countries,", "the governance mechanism and local/sectoral capacities may not be sufficient to guarantee coherence. Depending on the size of the country, the nature of hazards and the national versus local disaster risk management governance mechanism, national guidelines for conducting risk assessment may be useful. These would help ensure that all risk assessments conducted at local and sectoral level adhere to a certain level of standards and benefit from common methodologies and relevant datasets. National versus supranational disaster risk assessments: Risks do not stop at administrative borders. For some risks it might be useful to carry out a cross-border or supranational risk assessment in cooperation with other countries and international organizations (which might already have been done in the past). This is", "relevant for shared hazards (e.g. river basins) and hazards with potential cross-border impacts (e.g. industry and nuclear plants), as well as for potential cross-border cascading effects and interdependent assets (e.g. critical infrastructure).21 Supranational disaster risk assessments will have a specific scope and specific objectives of their own; risk-informing, for example, cross-border disaster risk reduction strategies, critical infrastructure protection and international emergency response and humanitarian aid. Time-horizon of NDRA: It is important to define the time-horizon to be considered in the risk analysis, based on the understanding of the implications this has for the assessment of impact and likelihood. The selection of a time-horizon depends on the type of decisions that rely on the NDRA outputs. For example, disaster preparedness and", "emergency management often address a time-horizon of three to five years, which gives sufficient confidence for the disaster risks identified. An NDRA process that informs national development planning may use longer time- horizons, especially in the context of understanding longer-term risk trends from climate change, urbanization, sustainable development or changes in disaster risk reduction policies. A longer time-horizon is especially critical when it comes to evaluating the benefits of investment in new development and in reducing vulnerability of infrastructure. This could be land borders or shared seas. Taking into account, for example, the UNECE Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents (unece.org/env/teia.html) and the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (unece.org/env/water). Scoring criteria", "for impact and likelihood The scoping stage should define the criteria for scoring impact and likelihood. The choice of criteria is largely a political decision and should be part of the shareholder discussions. Scoring criteria include the following: Impact criteria: While the complexity of impact assessment varies significantly across countries, along with the risk assessment methodologies, a consensus on impact criteria should be reached as a part of the scoping process. Impact criteria should be defined across different types of impact critical for the country. In the current practices of national risk assessment, the impact criteria are based on a broader understanding of the main \u201cvalues to protect\u201d, sometimes referred to as \u201cvital or critical societal interests\u201d. The following types", "of impacts may be considered: Human impact: Number of people affected \u2013 including deaths, severely injured or illness, displaced due to loss of home or Economic impact: Includes damage and loss assessment in financial terms \u2013 the costs of the damage, the costs of the reparation and restoration, the costs of emergency measures, the costs of long- term recovery (costs of disruption of economic activities, unemployment, indirect social costs such as those for the restoration of education and health systems). Environmental impact: Includes the loss of and structural damage to nature conservation areas, ecosystems and protected species, as well as general environmental pollution. The costs of environmental recovery are in most cases seen as part of the economic impact. Political", "and social impact: Includes political implications of a disaster, social psychological impact, disruption of daily life, and violation of peace and rule of law. It could also include impact on development gains, (in)equality and social cohesion, as a separate \u201cvalue to protect\u201d. The impact-level categories would be decided by the stakeholders and would vary from one country to another. Categories are defined for every type of impact and may be in different formats. For example, economic loss levels may be defined as an absolute financial loss or as a percentage of gross domestic product. The selection of labels associated with each category can become a sensitive issue, as this would be linked to the risk tolerance of a government and", "society. For example, one country might define as \u201cinsignificant\u201d a human impact as being no more than 10 fatalities, more than 50 injured, and no need for evacuation; whereas another might define it as no fatalities or injured and no one or just a small number of people evacuated for a short period of time. The following labels are commonly used for impact categories, although quantitative values should be assigned to each label and communicated to minor/substantial moderate/serious significant/very serious catastrophic/disastrous. Likelihood criteria: The selection of probability categories and their definition would also depend on the stakeholders and may have some different gradation in different countries. For example, one country may define the probability of >1 in 20,000 years as", "\u201cvery unlikely\u201d, whereas another might apply that label to the probability of one event in 100 years It is recommended to use quantitative likelihood categories wherever possible and avoid emotive terms or terms that could be misunderstood by others. It is also recommended to select a likelihood scale that can effectively cover the analysis outcomes of intensive and extensive disaster Technical scoping The technical scoping of NDRA goes hand in hand with the policy scoping. It considers available information on hazard, exposure, vulnerability and capacity in order to determine the relevant risk elements. Identifying and scoping hazard allows the NDRA to narrow the focus from the full range of hazards faced by a country to those that present the greatest", "risk to its safety, security and development. Scoping hazard includes deciding whether NDRA should be focused on a limited number of significant risks or on multi-hazards. Understanding which hazards NDRA is to be focused on requires careful consideration of the following: Existing hazard data (e.g. historical loss data) Regional and global trends (e.g. impact of changing climate) Economic activities that can trigger natural hazards (e.g. in extractive industries or un-managed land use) Technical resources available for conducting risk analysis (e.g. input hazard data and expertise for modelling complex interdependencies of Financial resources available for conducting risk analysis. It is particularly important to consider the balance between analysing intensive risks and extensive risks, and especially in relation to their respective potential", "impacts on sustainable development. Potential hazards include the whole spectrum of hazards across the following hazard categories: Geophysical (earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption) Meteorological/hydrological (flood, storm surge, cyclone, hurricane, hail, Climatological (drought, wildfires, frost) Biological (human epidemics, livestock pests and diseases, crop pests and Technological and human-generated hazards (increasing attention is being given to emerging risks from technological developments and the dependency of society on technology). Identifying and scoping exposure provides an initial understanding of what should be the focus of NDRA to match both the policy and the hazard scope. This may include various assets in the social, physical, economic, environmental and agricultural categories. NDRA should be responsive to the protection of those sectors that have priority importance for sustaining", "a country\u2019s communities and ongoing development or those that are most susceptible to hazards. NDRA may be focused on impacts that threaten the whole country or significant areas within the national territory: major cities, major river basins, regions in proximity of volcanoes, coastal zones, nationally protected areas, public structures, cultural heritage, or critical infrastructure (including cyber). Identifying and scoping vulnerabilities provides knowledge of the various types of vulnerabilities and interlinkages that should be considered in the assessment to match the policy scope. Categories of vulnerabilities include physical, economic, social, institutional, environmental, agricultural and Identifying and scoping capacities provides an initial common understanding of the indicators that would be used for assessing capacities to manage the risk of disasters or coping", "capacity as defined by the Open-ended Intergovernmental Expert Working Group. Flaws in capacity, such as weak capacity in enforcing building codes, are among underlying drivers of risk. The scope of capacity should be assessed at an early stage and in consultation with the stakeholders, because of the wide range of views on the definition of capacity, the issues that can be considered, and the role of stakeholders in collecting the data for assessing capacity. Some guidelines and methods are available, as well as many different sets of sectoral capacity (or resilience capacity) indicators, such as the following: European Commission Risk Management Capability Assessment INFORM indicators CADRI (Capacity for Disaster Reduction Initiative) methodologies Health-sector indicators for implementing the International Health However,", "there is variability across sectors in the availability of me\u000150 thodologies with a comprehensive list of indicators for disaster-coping European Commission, 2015.

Risk assessment is an extremely data-intensive process and conducting a national risk assessment may involve accessing information from a wide range of stakeholders including mapping agencies, scientific and technical ministries, universities and other research institutions, and the private sector. In addition, valuable new data and analyses are", "created during risk assessments. It is therefore necessary to develop a strategy to efficiently organize and manage the data as they become available, as well as distributing the results to participants and key stakeholders. A \u201cgap analysis\u201d (i.e. necessary data vs. available data) can be the starting point of such a strategy. Data management plans govern the process by which data are gathered from participating entities, the technical and quality standards (including data resolution) to which new data will be produced, how data will be maintained during the risk assessment, and the means by which the output data will be shared and secured. Data availability, accessibility and security are always major challenges in conducting risk identification and can have a", "significant impact on the credibility of the results. The quality of the results is directly related to the quality of the input data. Given the effort spent in collecting, preparing and maintaining all the necessary types of data, the return on investment can be maximized if the created datasets are shared and used many times. Figure 7 - Important qualifications of input and output datasets. These characteristics have technical, social, political, and financial implications for a risk assessment. At the beginning of the scoping and the risk identification process, arranging for commitments from data owners and designing mechanisms to facilitate data-sharing both technically and administratively can maximize the quality of the risk identification. To this end the scoping stage of", "the assessment has to result in a data quality protocol, taking into account the required resolution of data to complete the NDRA in accordance with its set objectives and scope. Open data and software standards and licensing options are now widely available for use by data providers and analysis software developers. These should be adopted where possible to ensure that information is developed, applied and maintained for multiple use and knowledge-sharing while still maintaining intellectual property interests and sufficient security for confidential information. The following are some of the main recommendations for managing data and developing data management strategies: Assign a clear coordination role in data management to the lead agency, including provisions for central data storage and the mandate", "to define Incorporate stakeholders, both as potential contributors and users of risk assessment data, early in the planning process. Provide stakeholders with an understanding of the importance and value of their data for quality risk assessment. Give them an opportunity to make substantive contributions to the data management plan. Agree upon the data quality and resolution (based on the NDRA scope), licensing, metadata standards, acceptable formats and other protocols as early as possible. Whenever possible, release data under open licences that encourage wide use for many purposes. Develop a common repository for data during the risk assessment to facilitate sharing of the results and outputs when the assessment is Document the data-sharing plan in a memorandum of understanding or other", "formal agreement that clarifies the expectations and responsibilities of participating stakeholders, including a non-disclosure agreement for restricted data. Data availability for NDRA is best ensured by means of a legal basis that consolidates the key provisions of the data management strategy, such as obligatory data-sharing, transparent data ownership, lead agency coordination, data storage and restricted access to confidential data. For further explanation of these concepts, see Module 9. Data Management throughout the National Risk Assessment Process Plan, in part two of the Element 4 - Developing NDRA required capacities This element describes the type of capacities that are required for implementing NDRA.

If not, it is recommended that capacity improvement be part of the preparation stage. Administrative capacities refer to the legal and institutional frameworks within the country and how inclusive they are for multi-stakeholder national disaster risk assessment. Characteristics that contribute to this include a clear division of roles and responsibilities across all stages of NDRA including communication, existence of required expertise or procedural possibilities of engaging external stakeholders in the NDRA process.

These will guide the process and provide the basis for resource allocation. They should clearly indicate the timeline, milestones and deliverables, roles", "and responsibilities of various stakeholders, as well as the budget within which the process should be completed and results delivered. They need to be endorsed by the designated national authority/authorities and supported by adequate resource allocation. A national disaster risk assessment is a project and must be managed as a project: i.e. with a project document, project management team, project board (part of the NDRA governance body), regular reporting and final evaluation. The evaluation is essential for identifying and documenting lessons learned so as to improve the next rounds of the assessment and future use of Ensuring sustainability of efforts should be a major consideration in the terms of reference. If the assessment is conducted with the assistance of international", "entities or the private sector, the terms of reference should include a requirement that knowledge for its updating and management is transferred to and built within national public authorities. Stage II Conducting risk analysis Risk analysis is performed by the technical team, based on the terms of reference developed at the end of the scoping and preparation stage. The process provides the tools for decision-making and engaging stakeholders in disaster risk management. It involves agreeing on a set of methodologies for analysing risk from various hazards and for merging the outputs into a common format for evaluating and comparing risks and communicating the Element 6 - Utilizing various risk analysis This element briefly describes various risk analysis methodologies, risk comparison", "techniques and considerations for selecting the most suitable methodologies. Many different and complementary methods and tools are available for analysing risk. These range from qualitative \u2013 based on the subjective perceptions of experts \u2013 to semi-quantitative and quantitative methods, including probabilistic risk analysis, which is the most rigorous method. The Sendai Framework encourages all-hazard disaster risk management. This requires an understanding of impact from multiple major hazards that a country faces, such as: ii) Aggregation and comparison of risk from all hazards iii) Sequential, simultaneous, cascading and interrelated effects of some For single-hazard risk analysis, aggregation and comparison of risk analysis, a wide range of methodologies, approaches and tools are available, with varying levels of sophistication. For sequential, simultaneous and", "cascading risk analyses, however, fewer approaches and tools are available. The selection of methodologies depends on what kind of decision the NDRA process has to support (see element 2). For example, investment decisions in DRR might require different methods than prioritization of national preparedness planning. In most cases, NDRA will be based on a combination of different kinds of methodologies that together provide appropriate results for the different decisions in the DRM governance process. Selecting an analysis methodology also means striking a balance between the Quality of the methodology and its appropriateness for the purpose the results should serve. Resources it requires: technical (including data, tools and expertise), financial and time. Significance of the risk and level of investment for", "managing the risk. Some methodologies, such as probabilistic modelling, can provide a comprehensive view of hazard, risk and uncertainties that may be needed for certain decisions such as in relation to the design of high-cost structural disaster risk reduction measures. For example, investment decisions for certain structural measures may require a cost-benefit analysis to choose the most efficient design; whereas some non-structural measures, such as educating schoolchildren to evacuate, have lower costs associated with them or would not require comprehensive results from probabilistic modelling. Sometimes the cost of prevention is low enough that it is better to simply invest in prevention rather than a sophisticated analysis of risk. Single-hazard risk analysis A single-hazard risk analysis has the following components: Hazard", "analysis: Provides information on where, how big and how frequent the hazard events are, and on how severe their effects are (e.g. ground shaking for earthquakes, wind speed for cyclones, etc.). Exposure analysis: Provides information on the presence, attributes and values of assets that may be impacted by a hazard. The NDRA scope, including criteria selected for evaluating consequences (e.g. impact on people or the economy), guides the selection of assets to be included in Vulnerability analysis: Provides information on how an identified asset reacts to the effects of the hazard. Identification of vulnerabilities is guided by the NDRA scope, including criteria selected for consequence evaluation, such as people, the economy, the environment and sustainable development gains. For many hazards,", "vulnerability assessment of structures and estimation of physical impacts is often the first step towards understanding downstream impacts on the population and the Uncertainty analysis: For all the components of risk analysis, it is important to associate a level of uncertainty or confidence level in the calculations or estimates. This can be done by tracking the uncertainty or confidence level at every step where an estimate or judgement or calculation is made quantitatively or qualitatively. Once these components are in place, a risk analysis can be carried out for each hazard. The following are the options for risk analysis methodologies, starting with the most sophisticated and resource-intensive one: Probabilistic analysis Deterministic or scenario analysis Historical analysis Expert elicitation There are", "advantages and limitations in using each of these methods and each of them is good for certain purposes. However, all of them should be utilized throughout the process of conducting a multi-hazard risk assessment. Brief description of each method is below. Probabilistic analysis: Probability is an inherent attribute of risk. All methodologies deal with probability either explicitly or implicitly but the probabilistic approach is a systematic and comprehensive methodology that quantifies these probabilities. Probabilistic risk considers a large number of possible scenarios, their likelihood and associated impacts. In this method, a significant amount of scientific information on hazard, exposure and vulnerabilities, as well as insights from historical loss and damage data, is used to simulate (or model) the complex phenomenon", "of disaster risk. Box 10- More about the probabilistic risk method and outputs While probabilistic risk analysis is resource intensive, it has numerous advantages, including Ability to measure the risk costs (average annual loss (AAL) or return period losses) and consequently the ability to undertake cost-benefit analysis of alternative risk reduction Ability to aggregate risks from various hazards based on annualized losses (AAL). Ease with which quantitative comparison of relative risk from various hazards can be Suitability for effectively capturing and quantifying uncertainties. Tendency to reveal a more complete picture of risk in terms of both likelihood and impacts. (Scenario and historical approaches, on the other hand, tend to drift towards \u201cknown\u201d and experienced risks, often leading to an underestimation", "of actual risk). Some common terminology used in probabilistic risk analysis is described below: Exceedance probability (EP) curve: The EP curve describes, for each level of dollar loss of interest, what the annual probability is for that level of loss or higher to happen. Figure 7 displays an example EP curve, where the annual probability of exceeding US$ 400 million is Sometimes the annual probability of exceedance is plotted on the x-axis and the dollar loss on the y-axis, but the concept is the same. Figure 7 - Exceedance probability curve The return period loss (sometimes referred to as the probable maximum loss or PML) is the loss corresponding to a certain likelihood, expressed in terms of annual probability of", "exceedance, or its reciprocal, the return period. Once the EP curve is constructed using probabilistic methods (or a number of scenarios with various likelihoods), loss can be obtained for any desired probability of exceedance (or return period). Similarly, the annual probability of exceedance can be obtained for any loss level of interest. For example, in Figure 8 the 250- year (or 1/250 = 0.004, i.e. 0.4% annual probability of exceedance) loss is $300million. Average annual loss (AAL): The long-term expected loss on an annualized basis, averaged over time. While there may actually be little or no loss over a short period of time, the AAL also accounts for much larger losses that occur less frequently. As such, AAL is the", "amount of funds that needs to be put aside annually in order to cumulatively cover the average disaster loss over time. AAL, in mathematical terms, represents the area under the EP curve. Figure 8 - Return period loss or probable maximum loss (PML) Figure 9 - Average annual loss (AAL) Deterministic or scenario analysis: A deterministic or scenario analysis is the process of analysing the impacts or losses from a single event (scenario). This method characterizes possible event realizations in terms of size and location of events, but does not fully quantify the frequency of occurrence of these events or assess their impacts in a probabilistic manner. Selection of the scenario and analysing the consequences may be supported by historical", "loss information or some level of scientific understanding of hazard, exposure and vulnerability in the region of interest. If when scenario or deterministic analysis is used in risk analysis, it is recommended that multiple scenarios with various likelihoods of occurrence (even if the likelihood is not explicitly quantified) be analysed to obtain a more complete picture of Box 11\u2013 Examples multi-criteria impact analysis The impact analysis in the scenario-based approach should take into account all different kinds of societal impacts. As defined in the Sendai Framework, the societal impacts to be considered are impacts on human health and safety, the economy, the environment, the social and political stability, cultural heritage and education, as well as negative consequences for SDG\u2019s. The", "impact on each of these societal values has to operationalized in one or more impact criteria, so the impact can be estimated in a transparent and comparable way for each risk. Examples of criteria in existing NDRA scenario based methods are25: There are several ways to operationalise the criteria: Quantitative indicators: this can be a number (fatalities etc.) or amount (costs), but it can also be a combination of two quantitative dimensions, for example number and duration (in cases of displacement or lack of basic necessities). Qualitative indicators: this can be any kind of single indicator or combination of multiple indicators, that predict a certain level of impact. Qualitative impact level descriptions: if it is difficult or impossible to identify", "measurable indicators, each of the impact levels of a criterion could be operationalised by a qualitative description of \u201cexpected consequences\u201d. For example, a description of tangible collective behaviour for different levels of social unrest. Each impact criterion needs to be operationalized in the same number of impact levels (for example 5 levels). There must be a consistency across criteria, as to assure that a certain level of impact on one criterion more or less fits with the same impact level on the other criteria. As the different societal impacts by nature are not interchangeable or comparable, the defining of such consistency requires both expert elicitation and a political decision. The data for analysis of impact (and likelihood) levels can be", "drawn from sectoral and single hazard risk analyses. If those are not available, the expert elicitation of the scenarios should provide the required information on the impact criteria/indicators.

Such databases can be used to conduct a historical analysis, providing information on frequency of occurrence, potential impacts and the overall risk associated with frequent events. A historical analysis cannot be used for infrequent hazards, such as earthquakes, and can be misleading by not revealing information about high-intensity events with low probability (e.g. a flood of one in a 100 year return period or 1% probability of occurrence in one year). Box 12 - National disaster loss", "databases will be used for monitoring Sendai Framework Besides being a data source to use in the historical analysis method, national disaster loss databases will be necessary for monitoring progress in Sendai Framework implementation at national and global level to report on Sendai Targets A to D, which measure loss, damage and impact from disasters. As of today, 105 countries have established national disaster loss databases. Many of these need to be updated and upgraded to comply with the Sendai Framework hazards coverage and monitoring requirements. Figure 10 - Historical loss databases are established and used in many countries around the world. Source: Global Assessment Report (GAR) 2015. Expert elicitation: If no other information or means to carry out risk", "analyses are available, individuals with good understanding of various components of disaster risk in the country can conduct the analysis using their expert judgement. While it is more common to conduct a qualitative analysis using the expert elicitation method, it is also possible for experts to provide a quantitative perspective on risk. This method has a significant amount of uncertainty for intensive risk and potential bias, particularly if a single expert is consulted. Consultation with multiple experts may reduce the potential bias. Box 13 - Considerations in establishing a national historical loss database The process of establishing or upgrading the national loss database is led by an appropriate national entity, although three scenarios may exist in the data collection process:", "Scenario 1: Local civil protection collects and reports to national level Scenario 2: National/regional assessment centres Scenario 3: Hazard specific national authorities. The choice of host institution is fundamental to the success and sustainability of the database. Hosting the database goes beyond the physical fact of having a computer or server where the database will be stored. The host institution is responsible for keeping the database up to date, coordinating efforts among different national and subnational entities who collect the disaster loss data, and producing Experience from many countries shows that long-term sustainability of a national loss database is contingent on having the database maintenance and data collection embedded in the operations of the host agency.

This includes deciding on the historical time frame and disaggregation level to collect data Developing an official sustainability plan endorsed by the host agency and other relevant contributing agencies.

Swiss national risk assessment benefits from large number of experts and their The Swiss national risk analysis of disasters and emergencies identifies a spectrum of possible hazards, develops specific scenarios, analyses their impacts, and assesses the likelihood of their occurrence. Hazard-specific workshops are held to assess the impact and likelihood of such scenarios. Five to ten experts from the public and the private sector, and academia, assess the extent of twelve defined", "damage indicators and the frequency of the scenario. Such assessments are carried out in structured group discussions, patterned on the Delphi approach. In the first round, the experts individually estimate the frequency and the extent of damage for each indicator (e.g. the number of expected fatalities). To assess the impact and frequency associated with the various hazards, the experts refer to existing research and information such as studies, event analyses, exercise evaluations, statistics, field reports and other scenarios. On the basis of available data, they investigate and assess the impacts of the specific scenarios. If information is lacking or of insufficient quality, they will resort to well- founded assumptions. In the second round, they discuss the variations of the individual", "expert estimations. The participants have the opportunity to explain their individual results. On the basis of this discussion, the experts reach a consensus on one value for each indicator and the frequency of the scenario. More than 200 experts were included in the analytical process leading to the Risk Report 2015. Even though risk analysis is not a hard science, the methodological approach allows us to assess a broad range of hazards in a comparable, systematic and transparent way. This approach also ensures that all the important stakeholders can participate in the assessment.

Usually several single-hazard risk assessments are carried out first and then the outputs are used as input to tools and techniques that allow the various risks to be aggregated, compared and evaluated for decision-making. Such analysis provides a more complete understanding of risk from all hazards. Aggregation of risks Although this process may sound straightforward, various issues may need input from experts. Issues include the interlinkages of impacts and whether the risk outputs from all the hazards are presented in", "a common standard metric that can be simply added up. For example, if risk analyses for multiple hazards are all conducted probabilistically, loss results (e.g. dollar losses, life losses) can be combined probabilistically. However, to be additive, the risk from each hazard needs to be represented in an annualized form (see average annual loss in Box 10), which can then be summed up to give an idea of total In contrast, return period losses at a certain return period of interest (see Box 10) cannot be aggregated as easily. If a scenario approach is used to calculate risk from various hazards, aggregation is even more challenging since it is harder to find a standard loss metric that can be summed", "up. For example, if all the scenarios are worst case scenarios, there is little value in knowing the sum of all worst case scenario losses since it is improbable that all worst case events will happen at the same time. Comparison of risks Several techniques and methods exist for comparing risks from different hazards. ISO guidelines on risk assessment provide a variety of techniques. Although not all of these techniques are commonly used in disaster risk management, most can be adjusted to use in comparing risk for risk management decisions. The following are three of the most commonly used Probabilistic risk analysis: Various risk outputs \u2013 such as return period loss at various return periods of interest or average annual", "loss (see Box 10) \u2013 computed for each of the hazards can be compared from probabilistic risk analyses conducted for different hazards. The exceedance probability curve, one of the main outputs of probabilistic analysis, gives users the freedom to look into a variety of likelihoods or diverse values of impact from different hazards to compare, prioritize and make risk management decisions. Multi-criteria impact and likelihood scenario analysis: In this approach, the different hazards within the scope of the national disaster risk assessment are summarized into a set of \u201cstress test scenarios\u201d in the context of all relevant coping capacities of a country. The method allows the outcomes of single-hazard analyses (e.g. probabilistic, deterministic) The scenarios are selected as broad as", "possible so as to provide better insights to decision makers on the range of possibilities. Therefore, if the resulting capability gaps are resolved sufficiently, a country is more or less resilient to any existing or future risk. This approach has been most commonly used for emergency preparedness, recovery and reconstruction planning for which the \u201cmaximum credible\u201d or \u201cplausible worst case\u201d scenario is of interest. The method can also be used for other disaster risk reduction decisions, but to that end requires careful consideration of the scenario selection, as the use of worst case scenarios favours intensive risks over extensive The selection of scenarios is largely based on expert elicitation and requires the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders and", "experts to provide the scenarios for all kinds of risks and capacities. The scenarios are analysed on two dimensions of risk: impact and likelihood. And the final outcome of the analysis is represented in a risk matrix of likelihood and impact, as a basis for prioritizing risks (see also box 16). However, the resulting risk matrix does not provide an absolute ranking of risks. The acceptable risk appetite, the current coping capacity and new opportunities for risk reduction are among the other factors that might influence how the priorities are defined. Box 16 \u2013 Risk matrix or multi-criteria impact and likelihood analysis A risk matrix is the common template presenting the impacts, likelihoods of risks and confidence levels. This matrix", "projects the outcomes of the impact and likelihood analysis onto two axes. The visual tool helps decision makers see a clear distinction between impact and likelihood levels. The actual impact and likelihood levels of different national risks represented in the risk matrix are the result of a single-hazard risk analysis. Another aspect that needs to be presented is the confidence level or level of uncertainty. The confidence level is an additional level of information supporting decision-making. Various methods to add this element to the risk matrix have been used in different countries and national guidelines. The image above shows two risk matrices with priority levels. The darker colour and number one denote the highest priority and the lighter colour and", "number 5 the lowest. On top the colouring for risks with the highest level of confidence and below for risks with the lowest level of confidence. The second one shows a broader range of high priority, as it cannot be ruled out that the risks should in fact be higher up in the matrix. Source: National Emergency Risk Assessment Guidelines, Australian Institute for Disaster The index-based approach: In this method, a wealth of information and data on hazard, exposure, vulnerability and capacity can be simplified to be represented with index scores (a number out of a full score) and then combined to present risk level with a single index score. The index-based approach provides actual risk values or likelihoods. Its", "main benefit, however, is the simplicity of using its output for comparing risk levels from various hazards or between regions of interest (e.g. subnational regions). Also subindices, if designed well and communicated transparently, can provide insight into the sources of risk from hazard, exposure, vulnerability or capacity. For example, the index for risk management (INFORM) , which has been developed at a global level to understand and measure the risk of a humanitarian crisis across various countries, assigns risks an overall score out of 10. It is a composite indicator combining 53 indicators. Figure 11 shows the INFORM multi-layer system. The elements in each layer are presented by an index value, which is calculated based on the contributing elements at", "the lower layer. Depending on the users\u2019 purpose and intent to target the disaster risk management measures, comparison and evaluation can be done using the indices at any layer.

Source: INFORM methodology document (accessed March 2017) Sequential, simultaneous, cascading and interrelated effects of some hazards The triple disaster in Japan on 11 March 2011 is a well-known case of sequential and simultaneous hazards with cascading effects. The disaster started with the T\u014dhoku earthquake, which killed about 100 people. The ensuing tsunami killed about 18,000, and there was uncertainty about the", "consequences of the radioactive contamination resulting from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown. The interaction between natural and technological hazards was amplified by local vulnerabilities, and the Fukushima nuclear accident was considered \u201ca profoundly man-made disaster \u2013 that could and should have been foreseen Other critical infrastructure in the affected area was broadly compromised, thus constraining efforts to contain the cascading effects of the primary disruption. Cascading risks and disasters have serious implications for national risk assessment processes, especially when they disrupt the functioning of society and the economy due to their impacts on critical infrastructure. It is vital not only to understand and assess cascades in critical infrastructure, but also to know how to stop them from escalating. Unfortunately, modelling", "such complex phenomena requires a significant amount of data and complex modelling tools and expertise, which can make it unfeasible to conduct quantitative modelling as common practice. Nevertheless, possible cascading effects of major hazards should be explicitly noted and quantified to the extent possible. A complementary approach suggests that the paths of cascades can be understood in advance of the triggering events by identifying sensitive nodes that generate secondary events and rapidly scale up a crisis. Risk scenarios based on hazard can be integrated with corresponding vulnerability scenarios using escalation points to represent unknown triggers. The involvement of all stakeholders such as emergency managers, governmental and non- governmental organizations and representatives of the private sector could help determine which consequences", "of a disaster could become the principal drivers of cascades.

Element 7 - Key considerations in conducting risk This element describes key considerations in conducting a risk analysis. More information on various methodologies and tools, and further resources relevant to conducting the risk assessment can be found in the modules on special topics", "and hazard specific risk assessment in part three. Identifying and compiling existing input data Identifying and compiling existing input data for various components of risk analysis are critical for the following purposes: a) Further refining the technical scoping, including selection of analysis methodologies, since the level of detail in risk analysis is often driven by the resolution or quality of the available data; b) Identifying data gaps and areas that require further data collection. Data and information needed for analysing disaster risk often reside in a country\u2019s research institutions, government laboratories, statistics offices, etc. Sometimes private-sector studies are made public, especially when commissioned by government entities. On a broader scale, existing regional or international studies, though they may vary in", "resolution, can be used to supplement other available data. Further considerations are described in element 3 on data management strategy of NDRA in this document and more details can be found in Module 9 on data management in part two of the Guidelines. Assessing disaster risk management capacities Understanding capacities is one of the main components of disaster risk assessment. It adds perspective when prioritizing and evaluating risks for decision-making. It is essential to understand capacities in order to quantify the total impact. Consideration needs to be given to how capacity assessment fits best in the process of NDRA and, more broadly, in disaster risk management. The concept of \u201clack of capacity\u201d is often considered to be part of risk", "analysis itself, as it is one of the risk elements, besides hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Determination of sources and drivers of risk The risk analysis phase provides the opportunity to better understand the underlying causes of risk. The risk assessment may highlight that a risk is dominated largely by the element of hazard due to climate change, exposure due to unchecked urban expansion, vulnerability due to lack of building code enforcement, poverty and inequality or capacity due to weak governance. And cross-cutting themes can be identified that influence several components of risk at the same time, such as climate change and rapid technological development. If there is a specific risk that can be reduced by a change in policy or", "practice that eliminates or diminishes the root cause of the risk, this should be noted in the assessment. Climate change impact Climate change is one of the underlying drivers of risk and it impacts both slow-onset events such as: sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification and extreme weather events such as: floods, cyclones, or extreme temperatures . Some disaster risks have a direct relationship with the increase in frequency and magnitude of extremes in climate variables (temperature and precipitation) and low capacity to Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report, 2014 Box 17 \u2013 Categorization of capacity The following list sets out the different ways", "in which countries categorize \u201ccapacity\u201d in the context of disaster risk: By phase of the risk management cycle: prevention, preparedness, response and recovery. By the structural nature of the capacity: structural versus non-structural. Structural means actual, physical structures (e.g. dams, dikes); non-structural means \u201csofter\u201d measures (e.g. policy instruments and community resilience). By \u201ctarget\u201d within a holistic approach: human, human-made environment (built and technical) and natural environment. From the perspective of the \u201cbuilt environment\u201d: (in descending order) spatial planning, building construction, technical systems within a building, usage of the building, human Based on natural/psychological mechanisms: \u201ccoping\u201d versus \u201cadapting\u201d. Coping focuses on tactical measures, based on the current risk level and previous events. Adaptation focuses on strategic measures in anticipation of future", "changes in risk. By institutional capability: administrative, technical, and financial. By element of risk: capacities to reduce hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. By element of impact: capacities to reduce human, economic, environmental and political- adjustment. In particular, the policies and investments in climate change adaptation and disaster risk management should be fully aligned to benefit from measures that address both and ensure an efficient and coherent use of resources. Therefore, it is critical that NDRA incorporates the impacts of climate change on the relevant hazards and risks. At national level, convergence of climate change adaptation and disaster risk management is with national institutions and common stakeholders, financial and operational mechanisms, knowledge and capacity, and data and analysis processes. For example, the", "government of Laos has recently formed a Department of Disaster Management and Climate Change (DDMCC) at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment to manage the resources and processes for effectively for managing climate change impact and disaster risk While it is clear that the climate is changing, there is significant amount of uncertainty about exactly how it will change and by how much. Future changes in climate variables depends on the future level of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and the response of global and local average surface temperatures to the increase in greenhouse gases. One way to address future uncertainty is to use climate change scenarios and projection models to describe possible changes to climate variables which are", "then used as input into hazard and risk assessments and provide a range of risk levels for different climate change scenarios. This would empower decisions in design of policies and investments to ensure for example, future infrastructure will withstand future extreme events. http://www.monre.gov.la/ Element 8 - Preparing the outputs of risk analysis for communication with stakeholders This element emphasizes the importance of using various tools and methods to prepare the outputs of analysis for communication and use by stakeholders for the purposes of NDRA. Presenting the results in a format that is understandable, relevant and useful to the stakeholders is key to the success of a risk assessment. A review of current risk assessment efforts shows that more innovation and", "collaboration with experts in communications and other disciplines is necessary to improve the translation of technical information into transferable and useful information for decision makers and practitioners. For example, presenting the risk and loss values in an economic or social context, or expressing probabilities within the political timeframe or human lifetime, especially for low-likelihood but high-consequence events, helps convey the risk message The final consolidated report of a risk assessment, communicating risk information to the general public or a local community, requires a different strategy from that for communicating the same information to economists or policymakers. It is recommended to pay close attention to the development of a communication strategy that breaks down the full risk assessment results into digestible", "pieces for different target audiences. Consider the goals for each target audience, varying from decision-making on risk prioritization and disaster risk reduction measures (NDRA stakeholders), disaster risk awareness and education (general public), to incentives for follow-up research (scientific community) and use of information for other risk assessments (subnational governments, sectors). The following tools and formats can be used to report the results for different Geospatial tools and mapping for hazards and risk information. For further information, see Module G on the use of geospatial data. Risk matrices for comparison and showcasing prioritization of risk levels to decision makers are a common format to use for all risks. See Box 16 in Scenario information depicted in maps and infographics, as well", "as preparation of exercises, to raise awareness among the general public. Brief snapshots of risk values, trends, with and without possible disaster risk reduction policies (if identified in the scoping step) and main findings for communicating with high-level decision makers.

Stage III Using NDRA results for disaster risk management and development decisions Element 9- Facilitating the process for evaluation and applying results in disaster risk management This element provides an overview of the necessary re-engagement between the technical team and the stakeholders to understand the NDRA results, evaluating the risks so as to prioritize them and apply the assessment to the original policy scope defined at the scoping and preparation stage. The outputs of risk assessment are inputs to decision-making on plans, actions and investments for managing disaster risk. Understanding of disaster risk through an NDRA provides a scientific and evidence base for decision- making and planning. Once the technical team", "prepares NDRA outputs, the results and findings are presented to the key stakeholders to ensure the outputs are understandable and are usable for the purpose that was originally defined in the scoping phase. This closes the loop between the phase of conducting risk assessment and the scoping phase. It is important to use the governance system of stakeholders that was designed at the early phases of the project to bring together all the key stakeholders involved in the scoping phase. This includes the scientific teams who conducted the risk assessment, the experts and the disaster risk management policy teams. The following are some key issues that must be discussed and decided upon through engagement with stakeholders: Evaluating and prioritizing the", "risks identified in the assessment. This process can be enhanced by setting transparent risk evaluation criteria or prioritization perspectives in advance (in stage I). The end result of the risk evaluation is a decision by the authorities (preferably the council of ministers or the national parliament), after stakeholder consultations and if possible public participation, on the \u201cprioritization of risk\u201d. This means defining the risks of high societal importance that require immediate attention: priority hazards, priority exposed elements, priority vulnerabilities and priority capabilities to then decide on and design various disaster risk reduction measures. It is recommended to record the decision rationale regarding the prioritization of risks, as well as decisions regarding treatment options, and whether or not the \u201crisk owner\u201d", "has the option of accepting, treating or transferring the risk. Acceptable levels of risk. Uncertainties in results, as these will affect DRM policy decisions. The stakeholders discuss disaster risk management solutions based on risk prioritization, and further understanding of causes and sources of risk and identifying and perhaps addressing the underlying causes of risk and other considerations such as the following: Large potential (indirect) consequences for Sustainable Development Goals. Need for synchronization with other policy fields such as climate change adaptation, critical infrastructure protection and other Balanced mix between prioritization measures to avoid new risks, reduce existing risks and manage residual risks by means of all stages of the disaster risk management cycle: prevention, preparedness, response and recovery. Need for", "continuity of existing disaster risk management policies. Potential for quick wins. Use of NDRA results for development planning, perspective planning and land-use planning. This dialogue may lead to demand for further analysis to gain additional perspectives, such as further understanding of risk drivers certain disaster risk management policies or cost-benefit analysis of specific This step is not by any means the end of disaster risk management or disaster management planning, but only an opportunity to evaluate options while interacting with the technical teams who conducted the national assessment. At the end of this step, the final set of risk assessment outputs \u2013 as datasets, maps, reports or any other formats, customized for the stakeholders \u2013 is delivered to the NDRA", "lead agency, and this cycle of NDRA comes to an end.

Element 10 - Ensuring long-term sustainability of This element describes the recommended long-term plan for the country NDRA system. The vision of Sendai Framework priority 1, Understanding disaster risk, and the approach presented in these Guidelines, is to have a well-established", "central system for understanding disaster risk in every country that produces the risk information needed for prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery, in order to build a resilient future. This central system, with a multi-stakeholder governance system, updates the NDRA every few years, conducts specific risk assessment on demand and maintains the national clearinghouse of risk data and information. It is important to put in place a long-term sustainability plan for the NDRA system. The plan should include the following: Clarity on NDRA updating time cycle. Operational mechanisms for \u201con-demand\u201d customized risk assessments such as sectoral risk assessment, or site-specific hazard assessment for significant investments. Defining a financial strategy both for NDRA updates and \u201con-demand\u201d assessments from public and private", "entities. Open data policies and data sharing from \u201con-demand\u201d private Mechanisms for international exchange and access to science and technology advances in risk assessment, including tools for communication and application in disaster risk reduction. Iterative processes for NDRA will further help to modify the course towards sustainable development. This requires having a legally and institutionally supported regular process of NDRA that is inclusive, science-based and sufficiently responsive to specific needs of the people, areas, sectors and assets most at risk. Concluding notes The Sendai Framework calls for strong political leadership, commitment and involvement of all stakeholders, at all levels, to pursue the goal of preventing new and reducing existing disaster risk \u201cthrough the implementation of integrated and inclusive economic, structural,", "legal, social, health, cultural, educational, environmental, technological, political and institutional measures that prevent and reduce hazard exposure and vulnerability to disaster, increase preparedness for response and recovery, and thus strengthen Such a complex task requires novel approaches and methods, and perhaps most importantly, new mindsets. Building resilience against disasters is largely a cross-cutting theme and starts from understanding disaster risk. A national disaster risk assessment sets the stage for successful disaster risk management ranging from prevention and reduction to preparedness and response and recovery strategies. Understanding disaster risk and its interaction with the Sustainable Development Goals, climate change adaptation and disaster risk drivers requires more effort to be directed at extensive risk and its interaction with intensive risk. It also", "requires a disaggregated exposure, vulnerability, risk and loss mapping, as well as a deeper discussion of potential governance While understanding disaster risk reveals inherent dependencies and interdependencies across many sectors, the notion of \u201csocially constructed disaster risks\u201d remains central, suggesting that vulnerabilities and capacities define and shape the disaster risk profile in a society. Addressing those vulnerabilities allows modification of the structural conditions of unsustainable development models, such as poverty and inequality that exacerbate disaster risk. This inherent linkage of disaster risks and long-term development brings another importance to NDRA as an instrument for managing a short- to long-term risk-informed development model that is sustainable and integrated, allowing for the consideration of multiple cascading effects across different sectors.

The National Risk Assessment (NRA) is a comprehensive all-hazard assessment of the most significant emergencies (malicious and non-malicious) the United Kingdom could face over the next five years. It is updated every two years (the last iteration was completed in 2016) and it includes the publication of an unclassified National Risk Register.", "The first NRA was first produced over ten years ago and has been regularly updated and improved The NRA draws on expertise from a wide range of departments and agencies of Government. Each department is responsible for leading the assessment of specific risks that relate to their policy remit and/or their responsibility for a specific sector of critical national infrastructure. The resulting product is an integrated whole-of-government approach to National Risk Assessment. The NRA identifies generic risks rather than every possible scenario and uses a \u2018reasonable worst case scenario\u2019 methodology to capture the most challenging, but still reasonably plausible manifestation of a risk. There are three stages to the assessment: the identification of risks; assessment of their likelihood and potential", "impacts; and comparison/ prioritisation of the risks. All three stages involve consultation with subject matter experts including independent challenge groups of academics and government scientists. Each of the risks in the NRA is described as a \u2018reasonable worst case scenario\u2019. For a risk to be included in the NRA, it must: have the potential to cause serious detrimental effects to the security of the UK, human welfare or the environment; have an expected impact that reaches a minimum threshold (typically significant damage to the UK); and have at least a 1 in 20,000 chance of occurring at least once in the UK in the next five years. Each risk is assessed on the basis of its likelihood and its potential", "impacts human health (including, mental health impacts people displaced/ evacuated, injured, or killed by the events); the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure and essential services (such as electricity, telecommunications, transport, etc.); the environment; and The assessment also includes a more qualitative analysis of the psychological impacts on the country (which includes public outrage and public perception of As part of HM Government\u2019s duties under equality and diversity legislation, both the process and the outputs of the NRA have been reviewed to highlight how risks or the required response may affect/take into account the needs of people of a specific gender, age, sexual orientation, religion, ethnic/national origin or disability. Long-term trends (such as climate change) are examined through their potential effects on the", "risks covered by the assessment. The governance mechanism for a risk assessment Each risk is assigned to a lead assessor (government department or agency) with support from internal and external experts. The overall production of the NRA, including setting the methodology, is led by the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, which is part of the National Security Secretariat in the Cabinet Office. The NRA is collectively agreed by Ministers. The NRA builds on risk assessment work conducted throughout the whole of Government and across the scientific and academic community. As such it benefits from the governance arrangements already in place for work carried out by government departments (including parliamentary accountability). Independent expert groups also help government departments and agencies improve their understanding", "of the consequences of their risks, such as the effect on the mental wellbeing of the population What were the existing technical, financial, and institutional capacities to conduct risk assessment? Evidence based policymaking means that government departments and specialist agencies conduct risk assessment work on the areas of policy they lead on as part of their ongoing work. Existing technical capacities are also complemented by close partnerships between Government and industry, for example private operators of critical infrastructure have worked with regulators and government agencies to fund research aimed at understanding emerging risks such as space weather and cyber attacks. Furthermore, Government works with the academic community to establish the areas of research where additional work is required. The Natural", "Hazards Partnership is an example of the level of cross Government technical and institutional capacities in this field. This partnership is a consortium of 17 public bodies (mainly government departments and agencies, trading funds and public sector research establishments) which aims to build on partners\u2019 existing natural hazard science, expertise and services to deliver fully coordinated impact-based natural hazard advice. What international support was used for the national disaster risk assessment? (if relevant) On certain topics, such as flooding or radiation emergencies, European research projects have yielded additional evidence which has supplemented our national analysis. The UK also regularly shares best practice with international partners bilaterally and through groups such as the Disaster Risk Management Knowledge Centre and the Disaster", "Prevention Expert Group (both EU Figure 1 - Governance diagram initiatives) and the OECD High Level Risk Forum. Informal regional networks such as the North European Forum for Risk Assessment have also been a source of good practices which have enriched our country's approach. What was the data management process? A simple file sharing system supported by a secure online portal with strict access controls has been used to store and disseminate the information covered by the assessment. As the NRA represents the synthesis of multiple assessments conducted by a variety of organisations, data informing the assessment for each risk is not centrally stored. HM Government releases a significant amount of information, including data sets, to support transparent policy making", "and foster innovation. An online portal (data.gov.uk) brings it together into one searchable website. Making this data easily available means it will be easier for people to make decisions and suggestions about government policies based on detailed information. There are datasets available from all central government departments and a number of other public sector bodies and local authorities. Technical methodologies A variety of analysis methods have been used in producing the NRA, ranging from stochastic modelling to expert elicitation workshops using the Delphi method. Historical data and lessons learned from past occurrences have been combined with probabilistic modelling of scenarios. How was the scope of the risk assessment defined? The scope of the risk assessment is based on the UK\u2019s", "national resilience legislation (the Civil Contingencies Act of 2004). Every iteration of the NRA undergoes a validation process to ensure relevant risks are captured in the assessment. This validation process includes: Workshops with industry, academia and local responders; Cross-Government group discussions (at operational, senior management and ministerial levels); Consultation with the Government Chief Scientific Adviser and the network of chief scientists across Government; and Parliamentary oversight, via specialist committees such as the Lords Science and Technology Committee. How was the risk assessment linked with DRR strategy The NRA is used for considering national resilience challenges at a Government level, and to provide guidance to local emergency planners and responders on the kinds of risks which they may need to address", "in their local The NRA is at the centre of the UK\u2019s national disaster risk reduction strategies. It informs national strategies on counter-terrorism, bio-security, flood resilience and cyber-security \u2013 amongst others. The NRA is also the backbone of a wider assessment of the national security risk landscape known as the National Security Risk Assessment (NSRA) which informs the National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review. What was the duration and budget of the risk The NRA is produced every two years and is funded as part of the standard operating costs of the department and agencies involved in the assessment. Were any guidelines used? The Cabinet Office, as the coordinating agency for the NRA, produces its own guidelines", "and methodology for departments and agencies taking part in the Country: New Zealand New Zealand\u2019s approach to initiating, designing, conducting and delivering national disaster risk assessment. Risk assessment of natural hazards has been completed in New Zealand for several decades, as legislated under the National Civil Defence Emergency Management Plan Order, which was last updated in 2015. However, up until recently, risk assessment was conducted in \u2018silos\u2019 (i.e. national security agencies were individually responsible for security assessments and natural hazard assessments were predominantly undertaken at a local level or independently by scientific research agencies). Further, there was not a consistent methodology available across Government agencies that enabled comparison of nationally-significant risks. Understanding of the risks associated with specific hazards and", "event scenarios is based on assessments undertaken by Civil Defence Emergency Management (CDEM) Groups, national agencies, and the science and research sector. The recommended risk management standard to be used as the basis for risk assessment and management in New Zealand is AS/NZS ISO 31000.2009. Under current CDEM legislation, the following hazards require risk assessment: b) volcanic hazards e) coastal hazards (including coastal erosion, storm surges, and large swells wild fires and urban fires k) animal pests and diseases plant pests and diseases m) infectious human disease pandemics (including water-borne illnesses) n) infrastructure failure o) hazardous substance incidents p) major transport accidents q) food safety incidents (for example, accidental or deliberate contamination Under the leadership of the Department of Prime", "Minister and Cabinet, New Zealand is developing a new methodology for assessment of nationally- significant risks. Hazards are assessed based on vulnerabilities and exposure, and taking a scenario-based approach, assesses overall level of risk against a standardised table of consequences across social governance and sovereignty, economic, environmental and built domains. The methodology also considers current and future risk management options. The governance mechanism for a risk assessment New Zealand takes an \u201call hazards, all risks\u201d approach to national security, considering a variety of hazards, as well as traditional security threats. The governance mechanism for New Zealand\u2019s national risk assessment follows this approach by bringing together a wide range of stakeholders from different sectors, as the focus is on understanding and", "managing generic consequences and vulnerabilities instead of a specific hazard. The risk assessment governance mechanism brings together stakeholders at three levels of Government \u2013 Ministers; Chief Executives; Senior Officials and other officials. Relationships with local government, quasi-government agencies and the private sector are also leveraged. Technical expertise used in the risk assessment itself was drawn predominantly from lead Government agencies, supported by the science and research sector as appropriate. A Project Team comprising officials from the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management, a business unit of the Department of Prime Minister & Cabinet, led a collaborative development and review process of the risk profiles and associated risk scoring. The review process involves a step-by-step analysis to ensure lead agencies", "have followed the risk assessment methodology, that content was appropriately placed within the profile, and that the scenario assessments were supported by evidence and expertise. This was undertaken in phases: An initial workshop with a large number of technical experts from agencies legislated to manage a variety of natural hazards. This provided an opportunity to test the assumptions behind consequence scoring and brainstorm alternative scenarios. The workshops were led by a member of the project team with appropriate technical acumen. A cross-check from another project team member. This allowed for both technical and formatting quality control review to be undertaken to ensure consistency and completeness with the risk assessment methodology. The project team also conducted an in-depth review of the", "risk assessment including: Validating the risk assessment approach taken by each agency. Reviewing all risk assessment material, including all \u2018workings\u2019. Providing feedback to agencies on the review of the risk profile. Ensuring, to the best of the project teams\u2019 ability, that no gaps in existing knowledge were found. Ensuring all referencing was identified on the risk profile or on accompanying documentation. What were the existing technical, financial, and institutional capacities to conduct risk assessment? The standard used as the basis for risk assessment and management in New Zealand is AS/NZS ISO 31000.2009. This standard forms the basis for the national level risk assessment methodology, noting some customisation to make assessments suitable to New Zealand. Individual Government agencies hold their own", "capacities to conduct risk assessment, drawing from this standard. Conducting a national-level risk assessment requires additional commitment from many of these agencies. Through the first iteration of the national risk assessments, it was identified that methodologies and approaches within agencies was not uniform and where it was present, tended to be focused on operational rather than strategic risk. The Hazard Risk Management and Analysis team in the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management was used extensively in development and application of this methodology, coordinating cross-agency assessments. What international support was used for the national disaster risk assessment? (if relevant) International best practice for risk assessment was considered during development of the national level risk assessment methodology, drawing on a", "range of publically-available reports. Science and research reports were also incorporated into the risk assessment. International experiences of wild fires were considered when generating relevant scenarios. What was the data management process? While the majority of the information is based on national experience and publically available, data for assessments carries a security classification and is not \u2018open\u2019. All risk assessment data is currently held within the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management and is managed in a variety of data formats, including excel spreadsheets. As part of continuous improvement of the risk assessment methodology it is anticipated that a shared database platform will be developed, enabling lead agencies to access and update assessment data as required. This will ensure", "that the methodology captures changes in risk over time. Information on natural hazards is publically available and supported by a range of central and local government agencies, as well as science agencies and research institutes. Technical methodologies The fundamental component of the technical methodology is that all national level risks can be compared using a standard set of principles, using the same likelihood and consequences measures to determine a greater sense of the current and future, and acceptable and unacceptable risks New Zealand face, and provide the opportunity to identify changing and emerging risks. The methodology for calculating scenario risk is based on a maximum credible event scenario approach, with consequence scoring for scenarios completed using a logarithmic scale. This", "approach allows different events, with quite different probabilities, to be effectively represented using simple scoring scales; a five point scale has been used thus far. The likelihood scale is also logarithmic, to be appropriate for a wide range of malicious and non-malicious risks. Assessments are based on current, available information and current risk management practices. All risk assessments include a level of expert judgement in order to make effective decisions under uncertainty. The likelihood for each scenario is assessed quantitatively wherever possible, but based on qualitative expert judgement where there is no data or body of evidence. The process of completing the assessments allows central government agencies to identify gaps in evidence or understanding as well as include their level", "of confidence in the information used. A confidence ranking has been used to show best judgement has been used in the risk narrative How was the scope of the risk assessment defined? The scope of the risk assessment has identified by central government agencies using a collaborative across-agency approach. How was the risk assessment linked with DRR strategy The national risk assessment is used to identify gaps in risk management, highlighting risks not currently accounted for or managed under Ministerial mandates, or central government agencies. Individual risk profiles identify current risk management practices across the \u20184R\u2019 framework (reduction, readiness, response and recovery). This includes identifying any governing legislation and plans. This can highlight any gaps in risk management of these", "individual risks. The national risk assessment and the methodology underpinning it have been aligned with other relevant and related work, such as: The Treasury Living Standards Framework; Local Government New Zealand\u2019s establishment board for a risk management agency; the Financial Market Authority Assessment; the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction; and the Climate Change Conference (COP 21) in Paris. New Zealand is currently developing a National Disaster Resilience Strategy, which will be an implementation plan for the Sendai Framework in New Zealand. The national risk assessment will provide a key input into this work by describing the national risk profile, highlighting key exposures and vulnerabilities, and analysing wider \u2018system trends\u2019 that the strategy needs to take account of. Together these", "two pieces of work are key to promoting a broad conversation about risk and resilience in New Zealand, and how we best position ourselves for the future. What was the duration and budget of the risk The risk assessment does not have a defined budget and has been an ongoing process as the methodology and evidence utilised have evolved over time. Work commenced in August 2015. Were any guidelines used? This question is covered off above. Examples of risk assessment results in use for DRR Individual risk assessments are being used by senior government officials to test and further coordinate arrangements for risk reduction, readiness, response and recovery for high priority risks. Annex 3: Definitions The combination of all the", "strengths, attributes and resources available within an organization, community or society to manage and reduce disaster risks and strengthen resilience. Annotation: Capacity may include infrastructure, institutions, human knowledge and skills, and collective attributes such as social relationships, leadership and management. Coping capacity is the ability of people, organizations and systems, using available skills and resources, to manage adverse conditions, risk or disasters. The capacity to cope requires continuing awareness, resources and good management, both in normal times as well as during disasters or adverse conditions. Coping capacities contribute to the reduction of disaster risks. The potential loss of life, injury, or destroyed or damaged assets which could occur to a system, society or a community in a specific period of", "time, determined probabilistically as a function of hazard, exposure, vulnerability and capacity. Annotation: The definition of disaster risk reflects the concept of hazardous events and disasters as the outcome of continuously present conditions of risk. Disaster risk comprises different types of potential losses which are often difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, with knowledge of the prevailing hazards and the patterns of population and socioeconomic development, disaster risks can be assessed and mapped, in broad terms at least. It is important to consider the social and economic contexts in which disaster risks occur and that people do not necessarily share the same perceptions of risk and their underlying risk Acceptable risk, or tolerable risk, is therefore an important subterm; the extent to", "which a disaster risk is deemed acceptable or tolerable depends on existing social, economic, political, cultural, technical and environmental conditions. In engineering terms, acceptable risk is also used to assess and define the structural and non-structural measures that are needed in order to reduce possible harm to people, property, services and systems to a chosen tolerated level, according to codes or \u201caccepted practice\u201d which are based on known probabilities of hazards and Residual risk is the disaster risk that remains even when effective disaster risk reduction measures are in place, and for which emergency response and recovery capacities must be maintained. The presence of residual risk implies a continuing need to develop and support effective capacities for emergency services, preparedness,", "response and recovery, together with socioeconomic policies such as safety nets and risk transfer mechanisms, as part of a holistic approach.

Joint Director of Health Services (MI), Meghalaya, Shillong. Chapter I - Introduction The", "primary focus of first aid training is to provide you with the skills and knowledge necessary to minimize the effects of accidents or illness. First aider provide a primary response to emergencies within the community and may sometimes be the first and the only person on the scene, it is necessary for him/her to remain calm, he should be able to make the right decision in a situation dominated by emotional stress and anxiety. Definition of First Aid : First Aid is an emergency care and treatment of a sick or injured person before more advanced medical assistance, in the form of the emergency medical services (EMS) arrives. Responsibilities of a first aider : Preserve life and provide initial emergency", "care and treatment to sick or injured people l Protect the unconscious l Prevent a casualty\u2019s condition from becoming worse l Promote the recovery of the casualty. BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL State Disaster Management Authority State Disaster Management Authority Philosophy of First Aid : In the pre-hospital setting, the key contributors to survival and recovery from illness and injury are prompt and effective maintenance of the body\u2019s primary functions: l Bleeding control (life threatening) Medical research data suggests that effective support of these basic functions provides the most significant contributor to positive outcomes for casualties in the pre- hospital setting. Chapter II \u2013Exposure to Biological hazards First aider may be exposed to biological substances such as", "blood-borne pathogens and communicable diseases, whilst dealing with a victim. These may result from dealing with: l Trauma related injuries l Resuscitation There are many different blood-borne pathogens that can be transmitted from a penetrating injury or mucous exposure, in particular, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C Virus and Human Immune deficiency Virus (HIV). Other diseases not found in human blood may be carried in fluids such as saliva (e.g. Hepatitis A and the organism that cause meningitis) or animal blood and fluid. Universal Precautions: First aiders should equip themselves with the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). This equipment is used to minimize infection from disease. BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL State Disaster Management Authority State Disaster", "Management Authority Exposure sources: The following are common sources of exposure: l All human body fluids and secretions, especially any fluid with visible blood l Any other human material Exposure Routes: The following are typically means of exposure: l Punctures or cuts from sharp objects contaminated with blood/fluid l A spill of blood/fluid onto mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth and/or nose l A spill of blood/fluid onto skin that may or may not l A laceration and contaminated with blood/fluid The expression \u2018universal precaution\u2019 refers to the risk management strategy used of communicable disease, by reducing contact with blood and other body substances. Universal Precaution include: l Wearing appropriate protective equipment for the l Treating all person as if", "infectious l Washing following completion of task l Appropriate disposal of disposal protective items and/or equipments l Maintaining good hygiene practices before, during and after tasks involving contamination risk. Immediate action at scene following exposure: For an open wound l Encourage the wound to bleed, thoroughly wash with water for 15 minutes and dress l Do not attempt to use a caustic solution to clean the l Seek medical advice as soon as possible For a splash to a mucous membrane l Flush splashes to nose, mouth or eyes thoroughly with water for 15 minutes BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL State Disaster Management Authority State Disaster Management Authority l If the splash is in the mouth, spit", "out and thoroughly rinse out with water for 15 minutes l If the splash is in the eyes, irrigate with the eyes open for 15 minutes l Seek medical advice as soon as possible For a splash to the skin l At the scene, wash thoroughly with soap and water l Seek medical advice as soon as possible if the exposure is medium/high risk. Chapter III- The Primary survey Basic of First Aid Most injured or ill service members are able to return to their units to fight or support primarily because they are given appropriate and timely first aid followed by the best medical care possible. Therefore, all services members must remember the basics. l Check for BREATHING: Lack", "of oxygen intake (through a , brain damage or death in few minutes l Check for BLEEDING: Life cannot continue without an adequate volume of blood to carry oxygen to tissues l Check for SHOCK: Unless shock is prevented, first aid performed, and medical treatment provided, death may result even though the injury would not otherwise be fatal EMERGENCY ACTION PRINCIPLES Survey the scene Once you recognized that an emergency has occurred and decide to act, you must make sure the scene of the BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL State Disaster Management Authority State Disaster Management Authority emergency is safe for you, the victim/s, and any bystander/s.

BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL State Disaster Management Authority State Disaster Management Authority Chapter IV \u2013Basic Measures For First Aid Lack of breathing and excessive loss of blood (circulation) . A casualty without a clear airway or who is not breathing may die from lack of oxygen. Excessive loss of blood may lead to shock, and shock can lead to death; therefore, you must act immediately", "to control the loss of blood. All wounds are considered to be contaminated, since infection-producing organism (germs) are always present on the skin and clothing, and in the soil, water, and air. Any missile or instrument (such as bullet, shrapnel, knife, or bayonet) causing a wound pushes or carries germs into that wound. Infection results as these organism multiply. That a wound is contaminated does not lessen the importance of protecting it from further as soon as possible to prevent further contamination OPEN THE AIRWAY AND RESTORE BREATHING When a victim is unconscious, all muscles are relaxed. If the victim is left on the back, the tongue, which is attached to the back of the jaw, falls against the back", "wall of the throat and blocks air from entering the lungs. Other soft tissues of the airway may worsen this obstruction. The mouth falls open but this tend to block, rather than open, the airway. The unconscious victim is further a risk because of being unable to swallow or cough out foreign material in the airway. This may cause airway obstruction, or laryngeal irritation and foreign material may enter the lungs. For this reason the rescuer should not given an unconscious victim anything by mouth, and should not attempt to induce vomiting. In an unconscious victim, care of the airway takes precedence over any injury, including the possibilities of spinal injury. Airway management is high priority. It is important to", "check the airway before the breathing. If air cannot enter the lungs due to some sort of blockage, the casualty will not survive for long. Airway management is required to provide an open airway when the victim: l Is unconscious; l Has an obstructed airway; l Needs rescue breathing. Always obstruction: compromised, the victim should be promptly rolled onto BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL State Disaster Management Authority State Disaster Management Authority their side to clear the airway. The victim should then be reassessed for responsiveness and normal breathing. Most airway problems are caused by the tongue and/or vomit. These can often be resolved by simple airway management. The muscle tone of the upper airway is directly", "related to the responsiveness: when sleeping, for example; minor degree of reduced muscle tone may lead to sufficient obstruction to cause snoring. When unresponsive, however, this obstruction can become complete and fatal. Foot remains in our stomach for hours, so most victims will have food in their stomachs, and it is possible for this food to regurgitate up from the stomach into the lungs. This is called aspiration. The acidity of the stomach contents and the particles size can block and damage the airway. Regurgitation is a passive process caused by a rise in stomach pressure overcoming the sphincter. It is usually caused by a full gut, obesity, (weight on the stomach) or air. How to check an Airway: l", "Open the mouth and look for foreign objects l Finger sweep (only if an object can be seen and can removed with a sweep of a gloved finger) l Perform a \u201cHead-tilt, chin-lift\u201d. Head-tilt, chin-lift: Adults and children (a child is define as one year to eight years of One hand is placed on the forehead or the top of the head. The other hand is used to provide chin lift. The head is tilted backwards without placing your hand under the neck. It is important to avoid excessive force, especially where neck injury is suspected. Make sure that you are wearing barrier gloves. Chin lift is common used in conjunction with The chin is held up by the rescuer\u2019s", "thumb and fingers in order to open the mouth and pull the tongue and soft tissues BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL State Disaster Management Authority State Disaster Management Authority away from the back of the throat. One technique involves placing the thumb over the chin below the lip and supporting the tip of the jaw with the middle finger and the index finger along the jaw lines. Care is required to prevent the ring finger from compressing the soft tissues of the neck. The jaw is held open slightly and pulled away from the chest. The finger is used to clear the mouth of fluid and debris in the unresponsive casualty. It should only be performed if", "you can see something to remove. It should always be performed with a gloved hand with the casualty positioned on their side in a stable side position. Insert your first finger into the high into the side of the casualty\u2019s mouth and perform a single sweeping motion to the opposite side, flicking out vomit, blood, and debris. Infants: An infant is define as younger than one year. The upper airway in infants is easily to obstructed because of the narrow nasal passages, the entrance to the windpipe (vocal cords) and the trachea (windpipe). The trachea is soft and pliable and may be distorted by excessive head tilt. Therefore, in infants the head should be kept neutral and maximum head tilt", "should not be used. The lower jaw should be supported at the point of the chin with the mouth maintained open. There must be no pressure on the soft tissues of the neck. If these manoeuvres do not provide a clear airway, the head may be tilted backwards very gently with gentle movement. Normal breathing is essential for maintaining life. Victims who are gasping or breathing abnormally and are unresponsive require resuscitation Causes of absent or ineffective breathing: l Direct depression of/or damage to the breathing control centre of the brain l Upper airway obstruction l Paralysis or impairment of the nerves and/or muscles of breathing l Problems affecting the lungs Signs in effective breathing may include: l Little or", "unusual chest movement BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL State Disaster Management Authority State Disaster Management Authority l Weak or abnormal breath sounds (wheezing, etc.) l Occasionally gasps l Reduced responsiveness l Unusual skin colour (pallor) l Rapid or slow breathing l Unusual posture How to check for breathing: The rescuer should- l LOOK for movement of the upper abdomen or l LISTEN for the escape of air from nose and mouth l FEEL for breath on the side of your face / movement of the chest and upper abdomen. l THIS SHOULD TAKE YOU NO LONGER THAN Kneel beside the victim\u2019s head. Maintained an open airways. Use resuscitation barrier devise. Take a breath, open your mouth as", "widely as possible and place it over the victim\u2019s slightly open mouth. Whilst maintaining an open airway pinch the nostril (or seal nostrils with rescuer cheeks) and blow to inflate the victim\u2019s lungs. Because the hand supporting the head comes forward some head tilt may be lost and their airway may be obstructed. Pulling upwards (with the hand on the chin) helps to reduce this problem. For mouth to mouth ventilation, it is reasonable to give each breath in a short time (one second) with a volume to achieve chest rise regardless of the cause of collapse. Care should be taken not to over-inflate the chest. Look for rise of the victim\u2019s chest whilst inflating. If the chest does not", "rise, possible causes are: l Obstruction in the airway (inadequate head tilt, chin lift, tongue, or foreign body) l Insufficient air-being blown into the lungs l Inadequate air seal around mouth and or nose If the chest does not rise, ensure correct head tilt, adequate air seal and ventilation. Following inflation of the lungs, lift your mouth from your victim\u2019s mouth, turn your head towards the victim\u2019s chest and listen and feel for air being exhaled from the mouth and nose. BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL State Disaster Management Authority State Disaster Management Authority The mouth to nose method may be used where the rescuer chooses to, the victim\u2019s jaws are tightly clenched, or when resuscitating infants", "and small children. The technique for mouth to nose is the same as for mouth to mouth except for sealing the airway. Close the victim\u2019s mouth with the hand supporting the jaw and push the lips together with the thumb. Use a resuscitation barrier devise. Take a breath and place your widely opened mouth over the victim\u2019s nose (or mouth and nose in infants) and blow to inflate the victim\u2019s lungs. Lift your mouth from the victim\u2019s nose and look for the fall of the chest, listen and feel for the escape of air from the nose and mouth. If the chest does not move, there is an obstruction, an ineffective seal, or insufficient air being blown into the lungs.", "In mouth to nose resuscitation, a leak may occur if the rescuer\u2019s mouth is not open sufficiently, or if the victim\u2019s mouth is not sealed adequately. If this problem persists, use mouth to mouth resuscitation. It may be found that blockage of the nose prevents adequate inflation. If this occurs, mouth to mouth resuscitation should be used. C-Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) EFFECTIVE CPR-30 compression followed by 2 breathes CRP is a repetitive cycle of: 1. Airway opening 2. Chest compression 3. Rescue breathing External chest compression is the most effective way of artificially circulating blood. Chest compression are accompanied by rescue breathing which provides oxygen that the blood delivers around the body to its vital organs. This is the only way", "to keep the heart and brain oxygenated until a defibrillator arrives. Recognition of the need for chest comparison: First Aider should use unresponsiveness and absence of normal breathing to identify the need for resuscitation. Feeling for a pulse is unreliable and should not be performed to confirm the need for resuscitation. When should CPR be performed? CPR should be performed on casualties who are not breathing or responsiveness and breathing inadequately. BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL State Disaster Management Authority State Disaster Management Authority Sometimes a casualty suffering a cardiac arrest may occasionally gasp, but this not constitute breathing. When not to perform CPR: You should not perform CPR: l When it is too dangerous to rescuers", "l When there are obvious signs of death, for example l When the casualty\u2019s injuries are clearly too severe Broken ribs are not uncommon during CPR. If this occurs, check your hand position and continue. You can reduce the chance of breaking ribs by placing and by avoiding excessive force during compressions. Broken ribs will decrease the effectiveness of the chest compression in generating blood flow, but this cannot always be avoided. After every two minutes of CPR, reassess for signs of life (coughing, breathing, or movement). This should take no longer than 10 seconds. If the casualty begins to show signs of life during CPR, reassess the breathing immediately. If the casualty is breathing, place them into the recovery", "position and monitor continuously. CPR uninterruptedly until one or more of the following l The casualty recovers responsiveness and is able to breathe on their own l You are placed at significant risk l You cannot continue due to exhaustion l Advanced help arrives and takes over the care of the Compression only CPR: If rescuer\u2019s are unwilling or unable to do rescue breathing they should not do chest compressions only. If chest compressions only are given, they should be continuous at a rate of approximately 100 per minute. Locating the site for chest compressions: There is insufficient evidence for or against specific hand position for chest compressions during CPR. For a victim receiving chest compressions, place your hands on", "the lower half of the sternum. Rescuers should place the heel of their hand in the centre of the chest with the other hand on the top. BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL State Disaster Management Authority State Disaster Management Authority Avoid compressions beyond the lower limit of the sternum. Compressions applied too high is ineffective and, if applied too low may cause regurgitating and/or damage to the internal organs. Method of compressions: Children and adults l Two hand techniques is used for performing chest compressions in adults l One hand technique is used to performed chest compressions on children under 8 yrs old. In infant the two finger technique should be used by lay rescuers to transfer", "time from compression to ventilation. Having obtained the compression point the rescuer places two finger on this point and compresses the chest. Interruption to chest compressions must be minimized Infants requiring chest compressions should be placed on their back on a firm surfaces (e.g. table or floor) to optimize the effectiveness of compressions. Compression should be rhythmic with equal time for compressions and relaxation. The rescuer must avoid either rocking backwards or forwards, or using thumps or quick jabs. Rescuer should allow complete recoil of the chest after each compression. Depth of compression: The lower half of the sternum should be depressed approximately one third of the depth of the chest with each This should equate to more than 5cm", "in adults, approximately 5cm in children and 4 cm in infants. Rate of chest compression: Rescuers should perform chest compressions for all ages at a rate of approximately 100 compressions per minute (almost two compressions per second). This does not imply that 100 compressions will be delivered each minute, since the number will be reduced by interruptions for breathe given by rescue breathing. When performing compressions, if feasible, change rescuers at least every two minutes, to prevent rescuer fatigue and deterioration in chest compressions quality (particularly depth). Changing rescuers performing chest compressions should be done with minimal interruptions to the compressions.

If not treated, this will cause death within minutes. One of the consequences of cardiac arrest is the disruption of the electrical activation of the heart. When this happen, the heart muscle can rapidly contract in an uncoordinated fashion. This rhythm is called Ventricular fibrillation (VF). While a heart attack is the most common cause of cardiac arrest, it is not the only cause and the majority of people who suffer a heart attack do not have cardiac arrest. The following signals of", "a heart attacked for prompt action l Chest pain, discomfort or pressure. The most common signal is persistent pain, discomfort or pressure in the chest that lasts longer than 3 to 5 minutes or goes away and comes back. l Unfortunately, it is not always easy to distinguish heart attack pain from the pain of indigestion, muscle spasms or other condition. This often causes people to delay getting medical care.

It usually is not relieved by resting, changing, position, or taking medicine. l Some individuals may show no signals at all l Discomforts in other areas of the upper body in addition to the chest. Discomfort, pain or pressure may also be felt in or spread to the shoulder, arm, neck, jaw, stomach, or back l Trouble breathing- Another signal of a heart attack is trouble", "breathing. The person may be breathing faster than normal because the body tries to get the much needed oxygen to the heart. The person may have noisy breathing or shortness of breath The person\u2019s skin may be pale or ashen (gray), especially around the face. Some people suffering from a heart attack may be damp with sweat or may sweat heavily, feel dizzy, become nauseous or vomit. They may become fatigued, lightheaded, or lose consciousness. These signals are caused by the stress put on the body when the heart does not work as it should. Some individuals may shown no signals at all. l Differences in signal between men and women. Both men and women experience the most common signals", "for a heart attack: chest pain or discomfort. However it is important to note that women are somewhat more likely to experience some of the other warning signals, particularly shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, back or jaw and unexplained fatigue or malaise. When they do experience chest pain, women may have a greater tendency to have a typical chest pain: of the breastbone l If you suspect that someone might be having a heart attack, you should: BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL BASIC FIRST AID MANUAL State Disaster Management Authority State Disaster Management Authority l Call 108 or the local emergency no. immediately l Have the person stop what he/she is doing and rest comfortably.

You can help by getting the medication for the person and assisting him/ her with taking the prescribed medication. l Offer aspirin, if medically appropriate and locally protocols allow, Adult chain of", "survival: The key steps to surviving a cardiac arrest in adults are described as the adult chain and each one needs to occur promptly to ensure survival. 1. Early recognition by a bystander that a problem 2. Early 108 call to activate the Emergency Medical 3. Early CPR to maintain artificial ventilation and circulation until the EMS arrives 4. Early defibrillation to deal with the heart\u2019s electrical 5. Early advanced medical care The survival rate for cardiac arrest is very low in most countries, including India.

Blood from the lungs is coughed up; from the stomach vomited; from the bowels it appears in the stools. With internal bleeding, sign of restless, weakness, pallor, thirst, and a faint, rapid pulse are usually present.

Secure it in place firmly enough to stop the bleeding or hold it in a place with firm hand pressure. Whenever possible, elevate the wound. Types of bleeding Arterial bleeding will be profuse and rapid because it is under pressure. It will be spurting as the heart beat, which will make it difficult to control and difficult for clots to form. This bleeding will be bright red as arterial blood is compromised of highly oxygenated red blood cells. Arterial bleeding is a significant and life", "threatening blood loss. Venous bleeding is a easier to control because the blood in the veins is under less pressure, which assists clotting. Because it carries less oxygen, venous blood is a much darker red. Dangerous levels of blood loss can occur from venous bleeding. Capillary bleeding is the most common and easiest to control as capillaries are closest to the surface of the skin. Blood tends to ooze rather than floe or spurt as the pressure in the capillaries is very low.

Disaster Terminology In order to understand the concept of disaster and disaster risk, it is important to have clear understanding on the following disaster terms and its definition: a) Hazard: A hazard is an unusual event that has a potential to threaten people\u2019s lives, their property and livelihoods. Some hazards occur naturally are of natural origin, like, earthquake, floods, landslides, volcanic eruptions etc. Some hazards are caused by", "deforestation, ethnic conflicts, war etc. However, a hazard by itself is not necessarily a disaster. A hazard only becomes a disaster when it adversely affects people lives, cause damage to property and or peoples livelihood. b) Vulnerability: Vulnerability is the extent or degree to which an individual, community, structure, service or geographic area is likely to be damaged or disrupted by the impact of a particular disaster. Families and communities are said to be vulnerable when they are exposed to known hazards and likely to be adversely affected by those hazards, if and when they occur. But these vulnerable conditions are not for everyone. A family living on the riverbanks for example, is vulnerable to specific hazards (in this case", "floods) compare to a family whose house is located on the higher ground that cannot be reached by floodwaters. c) Disaster: A disaster can be defined as the serious disruption of the functioning of a community, environmental losses, which exceed the ability of the effected people to cope using their own d) Emergency: Risk that can be managed using existing resources and support in a given condition e) Response: Actions taken immediately following the impact of a disaster when exceptional measures are required to meet the basic needs of the survivors f) Rehabilitation: Actions taken in the aftermath of a disaster to: Assist victims to repair their dwellings; Re-establish essential services; Revive key economic and social activities g) Reconstruction: Permanent", "measures to repair or replace damaged dwellings and infrastructure and to set the economy back on course. h) Development: Sustained efforts intended to improve or maintain the social and economic well- being of a community. i) Disaster Preparedness: Ability to predict, respond to and cope with the effect of a disaster. j) Disaster mitigation: Measures taken in advance of a disaster aimed at reducing its impact on society and the environment. k) Prevention: Activities designed to provide permanent protection from disasters. l) Disaster Risk Reduction: It is a conceptual framework to include comprehensive set of activities & elements so as to minimize vulnerabilities and disaster risks throughout a society, to avoid (prevention) or to limit (mitigation and preparedness) the adverse", "impacts of hazards, within the broad context of sustainable development. m) Disaster Risk Management: The systematic process of using administrative decisions, organization, operational skills and capacities to implement policies, strategies and coping capacities of the society and communities to lessen the impacts of natural hazards and related environmental and technological disasters. n) Resilience: The ability of individuals, communities, organizations, or countries exposed to disasters and crises and underlying vulnerabilities to: Reduce the impact of; Recover from the effects of adversity without compromising their long term prospects o) Contingency planning: Contingency planning is a tool to anticipate and solve problems that typically arise during humanitarian response. Disaster Management Cycle Disaster Management can be defined as the body of policy and administrative", "decision and operational activities which pertains to the various stages of disaster at all levels. Broadly disaster management can be divided into pre-disaster and post \u2013 disaster contexts. The two context encompass various activities under its umbrella which aims at prevention and mitigation, as well as response. Disaster management consist of different phases. The time period for each phase may depend on the type and severity of the disaster. Disaster phase \u2013 The phase during which the event of the disaster takes place. This phase is characterized by profound damage to human society. This damage / loss may be that of human life, loss of property, loss of environment, loss of health or anything else. In this phase, the population", "is taken by profound shock. Rescue phase \u2013 This is the period that immediately follows the occurrence of the disaster. In a way, all individuals respond to the disaster, but in their own ways. Almost everyone is willing to help. The first important step during first 48 hours after a disaster is to save maximum number of lives. Food, shelter, clothing can be taken care of in later stage. The immediate need is to have search and rescue teams in place along-with emergency medical assistance which can save lives. Disaster Management must stress on immediate need assessment after a disaster. This need assessment will be important for government organizations, NGOs as well as international bodies. The accuracy of need assessment", "will determine the efficiency of management. Relief Phase \u2013 During relief phase, there should be a need assessment of survivors and based upon that immediate relief like food, clothing and shelter must be provided. Depending on the initial needs assessment, relief is provided to the survivors. The relief must be adequate and appropriate to the culture of the affected community. The relief is generally provided by external agencies (NGOS, INGOs) and Government resources. Immediate medical need includes immediate medical assistance, safe drinking water, nutritious food, temporary shelters, food, clothing, information on missing relatives, psycho-social assistance to trauma victims, special care to children, elderly and physically challenged special attention to pregnant and lactating women. Recovery phase \u2013 When the immediate needs", "of the population are met, when all medical help has arrived and people have settled from the hustle \u2013 bustle of the event, they begin to enter the next phase, the recovery phase which is the most significant, in terms of long term outcome. It is during this time that the victims actually realize the impact of disaster. It is now that they perceive the meaning of the loss that they have suffered. They are often housed in a camp or in some place which is often not their house, along with other victims. When the victims have recovered from the trauma both physically and mentally, they realize the need to return back to normal routine. That is, to pre-disaster", "life. During this phase, they need resources and facilities so as to enable them to return back to their own homes, pursue their occupation, so that they can sustain their life on their own, as the help from the government and other non-governmental organizations is bound to taper in due course. Thus, they are provided with a whole new environment, adequate enough to pursue a normal or at least near normal life. This is called rehabilitation. During rehabilitation phase, adequate care is taken to follow all safety measure to prevent and minimize future impact of hazard. Also, the sustainable development approach is kept in mind during the whole process of rehabilitating and restructuring the community. During this phase, earthquake resistant", "houses are built, tsunami preventions are taken while building houses, cyclone resistant houses and flood resistant raised platform houses are built. Also, during rehabilitation, the community is settled in a safe location and as far as possible. Heterogeneous community settlements are preferred to eliminate social issues of caste and class. Prevention phase \u2013 This is the phase which indicates the start of pre-disaster phase. It engrosses measures to be taken in order to prevent a specific hazard from becoming a disaster. There are different measures required for different hazard. Primary responsibility rest with the government as actions taken in this phase requires large investment and work to ensure long term benefit. Only the government has the strength to implement these", "activities with high funds and necessary resources in place. The measures include, for example, increasing the capacity of a dam to prevent floods, activities promoting communal harmony at all levels to prevent riots, high construction and safety standards in industries and government offices and all other structures in order to prevent fire. Prevention should be at all levels- community level, local level and government level. Mitigation phase \u2013 The notion of this phase is to mitigate the impact of a disaster if ever a disaster takes place. This phase includes technology and scientific techniques too. For example, predicting the path, time to be taken of a cyclone after knowing that it is approaching the country is one mitigation strategy so", "as to avoid losses of lives and property. Having a natural mangroves plantation along the coast is one mitigation measure. Construction of earthquake resistant buildings is another mitigation measure. Working on mitigation phase is also the responsibility of the government because such initiative at the local and community level is very difficult as huge funds and resources are required. Increasing, large funding organization such as IMF, World Bank etc. spend huge amount of funds in mitigation program globally. Preparedness phase \u2013 This phase involves the development of awareness among the population on the general aspects of disaster and on how to behave in the face of a future disaster. This includes education on warning signs of disasters, methods of safe", "and successful evacuation and first aid measures. Preparedness must be on part of individual organizations as well as community as a whole. Preparedness phase also deals with the preparations which are needed on individual, community, authoritative level when a disaster occurrence cannot be avoided and a disaster is sure to happen. Community based disaster management plans must be formed with the help of local NGOs. 2. DISASTER SCENERIO IN ASSAM Learning Objectives: To understand the major hazards in Assam List out the natural and man-made disasters in Assam North East India is located in an earthquake prone zone, (zone v) of the Indian subcontinent. In this region earthquake comes with land sliding flood and along series of smaller magnitude earthquakes.", "Here earthquakes of upto MM intensity IX can be expected. According to a hazard map by the Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program, the state can expect to have a peak gravitational acceleration (PGA) of 0.24g to 0.48g. The region where the highest PGA can be expected is along the state's border with Meghalaya, the site of the Great Indian earthquake of 1897. Seasonality disaster calendar of Assam Jan Feb Mar Apr May June July Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec 3 Household fire 2.1 Review of Assam flood 2012 Total number of districts affected Total number of villages affected Total population affected Total crop area affected 2.55 lakh hector 3.28 lakh hector Human lives lost Relief camps established Damage of property", "2.2 Major earthquakes in Assam: Earthquakes during non-instrumental period in Assam: 1548, 159, 1601, 1642, 1663, 1696, 1756, 1772, Earthquake during instrumental period in Assam: 1869,1897, 1923, 1930, 1943, 1947, 1950, 1985, 1984 Meghalaya,Guwahati Near Rima, Tibet 2.3 Disaster Management in Assam Assam is one state in India, which has high number of disasters occurring on an average. It is also a state where a high number of populations are vulnerable to these disasters and where the coping capacity is minimal to deal with disaster risk. This is one state, due to the above mentioned reasons, which has an immediate need to practice disaster management with long terms strategies and sustainable developmental approach. 2.4 Hazards in Assam The major hazards", "in Assam: Earthquake, Floods, Fire, Landslides, ethnic violence and Cyclone. Assam represents highly flood-prone region characterized by severe hazards of floods. Although occurrence of flood has been an age-old phenomenon in the riverine areas of this region, the extent of damage caused by the flood has increased significantly in recent years. With more than 40 percent of its land surface susceptible to flood damage, the total flood-prone area in the Brahmaputra valley is about 3.2 Mha. (Goswami, 2001). Damage may occur to human settlements, buildings, structures and infrastructure, especially bridges, elevated roads, railways, water towers, water treatment facilities, utility lines, pipelines, electrical generating facilities and transformer stations. Aftershocks can do much damage to already weakened structures. Significant secondary effects include", "fires, dam failures, and landslides, which may block waterways and also cause flooding. Damage may occur to facilities using or manufacturing dangerous materials resulting in possible chemical spills. There may be a breakdown of communications facilities. Destruction of property may have a serious impact on shelter needs, economic production and living standards of local populations. Depending on the vulnerability of the affected community, large numbers of people may be homeless in the aftermath of a disaster. 2.5 Vulnerability in Assam 1. People living on the banks of Brahmaputra river 2. Village islands go under water totally during floods 3. Assam comes under earthquake zone V 4. Workers working in petroleum and gas factories 5. Bomb blasts occur in Assam as", "a result of insurgent activities 1. There are differences in the society (1983 Bangla-Mishing riots) 2. In equalities in Education Access 1. Economically weak population resides on the banks of the Brahmaputra River 2. High rate of unemployment in the state 3. No concept of insurance in most of the parts of Assam 1. Earthquake zone V 2. During floods, Brahmaputra expands with a wide reach 2.6 Coping Capacity in Assam: Coping Capacity in Assam can be attributed to the indigenous knowledge of the tribes in dealing with disasters. People living on river islands have skill of making quick boats from banana shaft to protect their family and valuables. The fisher-folk on river islands can predict the increase in flow", "of river and probable floods due to their experiences. Such indigenous knowledge needs to be documented and capacity be Also, people are hard working and do not fear from engaging themselves into hard physical work. This capacity can be utilized to quickly move to recovery and rehabilitation phase. 3. CONCEPT OF CBDP & ITS PROCESS Learning Objectives: To understand the different components of CBDP Community Based Disaster Preparedness emphasize collective community action and the internal mobilization of resources to support the community\u2019s effort to be self-reliant to the extent possible and for a more systematic and effective mobilization and use of external resources needed to implement plans and projects identified by the community members to be most relevant. The process", "of CBDP aims at the following: 1. The community should be made well aware of the risk they are living with. 2. Communities in high risk areas have been developing their own coping mechanisms and strategies to reduce and deal with the impact of disasters. CBDP recognizes the imperativeness of local knowledge and resources, and strengthen them in order to improve the capacity of people to withstand the impact of disasters. 3. Ownership of disaster reduction should not be stripped from local people who should be left even more powerless in case external intervention does not occur. 4. Disaster reduction activities should be based on participatory approaches involving local communities as much as possible, considering them as a proactive and", "not passive target for 5. Involvement and participation of communities will ensure a collective and coordinated action during emergencies. 6. Building community leadership and a chain of trained community cadres through participatory approaches can help harness the resilience and resourcefulness of the community to cope. 7. Solution is sustainable if it comes from people themselves rather than trusting upon them. 8. It is not only the big disasters that destroy life and livelihoods. Accumulated losses from small floods, droughts and landslides can exceed the losses from big disasters contribute significantly to increased vulnerability at local level. These disasters attract little media attention and communities are often left their own to cope with the destruction. This provides another reason to invest", "in community based disaster preparedness. Importance of CBDP- It is at the community level where effects of disasters are felt the most and also where the physical, social and economic risks can be most adequately assessed and managed. Nobody is more interested in understanding and improving local affairs and conditions than the community residents themselves. Nobody can understand local opportunities and constraints better than the local residents The first and quickest response to a disaster in any community will always come from the community members themselves. For disaster risk reduction initiatives to be more effective generation and analysis of hazard and disaster related data and information should be in a manner and language that is understood by the Because the", "community is involved in the whole process, their felt and real needs as well as inherent needs are considered. There is more likelihood that problems will be addressed with appropriate interventions. 4. PERSONAL AND SAFETY MEASURES DURING DISASTERS Learning Objectives: Familiarisation with the various safety measures to be adopted during disasters. Move beds away from windows. Move or secure hanging objects over beds, couches, and other places where people sit or lie. Keep shoes and a flashlight under the bed. Keeping shoes under the bed ensures quick access to prevent cutting feet on glass and reduces the risk that glass could fall into them. Store heavy and breakable objects on low shelves. Weed killers, pesticides, and flammable products should be", "stored on bottom shelves or in closed cabinets with latches. Chemicals will be less likely to create hazards if they are stored in lower, confined locations. Secure bookshelves, water heaters, and tall furniture to wall studs. Install latches on all cabinets, and anchor overhead lighting fixtures. Secure items that might fall, such as televisions. Develop a home earthquake plan so that you know what to do during and after an earthquake. Conduct earthquake drills with your family or co-workers. Locate safe spots (e.g., under a sturdy table), and identify danger zones (e.g., near windows). Develop a plan for reuniting all family members after an earthquake occurs. Keep supplies on hand, including food and water for 3 days, a flashlight with", "extra batteries, a portable radio, a fire extinguisher, and tools. Drop, cover, and hold. Move only as far as necessary to reach a safe place. Most persons injured in earthquakes move more than 5 feet during the shaking. If indoors, stay there until the shaking stops. Many fatalities occur when people run outside, only to be killed by falling debris from collapsing walls. It is safer to stay indoors until the shaking stops and it is safe to exit. When going outdoors, move quickly away from the building to prevent injury from falling debris. If outdoors, find a spot away from buildings, trees, streetlights and power lines, and overpasses. Drop to the ground and stay there until the shaking stops.", "Injuries can occur from falling trees, street lights and power lines, or building debris. If in a vehicle, pull over at a clear location free of hazards and stop. Stay in the vehicle with seatbelt fastened until the shaking stops. Turn on the radio to get information regarding the quake and any damage to roadways that may have occurred. If in a high-rise building, expect the fire alarms and sprinklers to go off during an earthquake. Check for and extinguish small fires. Do not use the elevators. If in a coastal area, move to higher ground. Earthquakes often generate tsunamis. If in a mountainous area or near unstable slopes or cliffs, be alert for falling rocks and other debris that", "could be loosened by the earthquake. Also, watch for landslides that could be triggered by the Know the flood risk in the area, including the elevation above flood stage and the history of flooding Prepare a flood evacuation plan and practice the route. Be aware of which roads become flooded and which remain passable. The entire family should know where to go if they have to evacuate. Keep important documents in a water-proof box. Most documents can be replaced, but some are more difficult to replace than others. Protecting them in a water- (and fire-) proof container is the safest plan of action. Elevate the furnace, water heater, and electric panel to at least one foot above the level of", "the floodplain (also called the Base Flood Elevation). In some areas, elevating these appliances and utilities may mean relocating them to a higher floor or even to the attic. Move furniture and other items to a higher level. Even if the main floor of the home is flood damaged, moving furniture and other items to a higher level will reduce flood losses. Avoid driving- Reserve the roads for those who are in emergency situation. Be alert for signs indicating land movement. Landslides can occur weeks or months after intense Plant ground cover on slopes and build retaining walls. Try and get out of the path of the landslide or mudflow Run to the nearest high ground in a direction away", "from the path. If rocks and other debris are approaching, run for the nearest shelter such as a group of trees or a Listen to a radio or television for the latest emergency information. Stay away from the slide area. There may be danger of additional slides. In the event of a fire, always, remember that time is precious and every second counts. Follow the following Stay calm, don't panic and don't run. Raise alarm and alert everyone in your premises. Escape first and then call for help. Use nearest available exit routes. While leaving the premises, close all doors and windows behind you if possible but must ensure that anybody is left behind and you are safe. Use only", "escapes routes because they are built for the purpose. Use Staircases. \"Don't use Lifts'. If you come to a closed door, use the back of your hand to feel the top of the door, the doorknob and the cracks between the door and door frame to make sure that fire is not on the other side. If it feels hot, use your secondary escape route. Even if the door feels cool, open it carefully. Brace your shoulder against the door and open it slowly. If heat and smoke come in, slam the door and make sure it is surely closed, then use your alternate escape route. If you are trapped in smoke logged area, lie down and keep your nose", "close to floor and crawl towards an exit point. If you become trapped in your room closes the door and blocks any gaps which might let smoke or fumes through. Shout from the window to attract the attention of rescue team as well as others. Never stand up in a fire, always crawl low under the smoke and try to keep your mouth covered. Never return to a burning building for any reason; it may cost your life. Never go back into a burning building for any reason. Teach children not to hide from fire fighters. If someone is missing, tell the fire fighters. They are equipped to perform rescues safely. Don't secure open fire/smoke check door open as they", "limit the spread of fire smoke when in closed position. Don't be tempted to clutter the stairs, corridors and lobbies as they are your escape routes. Never use the lift. It you have to leave the building use the staircases. Do not stop to collect belongings. Don't shout or run. This tends to cause panic to others. Prevention & Mitigation measures by the community people without external support. 5. HAZARD PREVENTION AND MITIGATION- PROCESS & STEPS BY COMMUNITY Hazard Prevention: This covers mechanisms designed to impede the occurrence of a Hazard event and/ or prevent such an occurrence from having harmful effects on communities and facilities. Hazard Mitigation: covers mechanisms which reduce the impact of the forces of hazard that", "minimize the effects of hazards and thus lessen the magnitude of a disaster. Community Readiness: includes measures & mechanisms where Group/community organization functions collectively and prepares for any hazard that is going to happen. Example: Plantation of trees can reduce the force of water and also that of the landslides on the slopes of mountains. Use of non- inflammable construction material in houses can reduce the spread of fire, and plantation of mangroves can slow down the speed of sea water and wind in a cyclone. All these effort reduce / mitigate the impact of hazard. Example: Fire can be prevented from occurring. Having Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCBs) installed along with the electric connections cut the flow of current and", "can help preventing the spread of fire due to short circuits. Similarly, de-siltation of river beds can prevent floods from happening. Also maintaining proper green cover on hill slopes can prevent landslides in the Example: Having search & rescue team, water & sanitation team, establishment of community fodder and grain bank, running community kitchen, setting up emergency community shelter, creating community emergency funds etc. can be called as community readiness measures. 6. IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN CBDP Learning Objectives: \uf0a7 Importance of Community Participation in Disaster Preparedness Disasters can become uncontrollable, once the event has got underway. Therefore, preventive steps need to be taken before, during and after the disaster events. If the community is not well prepared, control", "over the disaster event would be usually lost during its occurrence. If each individual in the community is familiar with ways of coping and precautionary measures, then the disruption by a disaster can be reduced. All communities and villages have some vitally important assets to deal with disasters. These may include knowledge of disaster warning signs, locally safe and vulnerable areas, experience of past disasters, methods of survival and social relations that are often vitally important in coping with crisis. Local communities have an active part to play before and after disasters because: \u2022 More number of lives can be saved during the first few hours after disaster has occurred through local response teams, before help arrives from elsewhere. \u2022", "The numerous problems of survival and health resulting from a disaster are dealt with more efficiently, if the community is active and well organized (WHO 1989). The key aspect of community involvement is the sustainability of community level initiatives for disaster reduction. External agencies, like government, non-government organizations may initiate and implement community level programs before and after disasters. However, such initiatives many times discontinue once the external support is ended. There can be many reasons behind this lack of sustainability, some of which may be the lack of partnership, participation, empowerment and ownership of local communities. Unless the disaster risk management efforts are sustainable at individual and community level, it would be difficult to reduce the vulnerability and losses.", "It is therefore important to involve people in decision making on policies and strategies that should be followed for their development in the community. Importance of Community Involvement: Local people are capable of initiate and sustain their own community development. Various community members and groups in the community may have different perceptions of risk and varying vulnerabilities. Outcomes of Community based disaster risk reduction in the community level: There can be various reasons for which we need to discuss CBDP with the community but some of the important reasons are listed below. Generally, a hazard can strike anyone, irrespective of caste, sex, religion, age, class etc. But it may affect people differently because their capacity to respond to a hazard", "varies. On the other hand, if the community understand CBDP, it will be easy for them to engage & direct the risk reduction & the contingency planning process with focus upon the needs & situation of the elderly. If they can direct the planning from collective point of view then it may be easy for the other community members to plan measures considering their needs & place them on priority for rescue at the time of hazard strike & even after that for their relief & rehabilitation. Also, the involvement of community can give very useful insights & ideas about various traditional/indigenous ways of coping which others can make use of to cope up with the hazard Very importantly, since", "the community can play a very crucial role in taking right decisions in planning by sharing their valuable experiences. Community can also play a very crucial role in hazard identification & risk analysis with the insights of experiencing disaster they must have come across in their whole life. 7. CHARACTERISTIC OF SAFE AND RESICIENCE COMMUNITY Learning Objectives: To enumerate how community can be called safer, resilient for disaster preparedness. The aim of community Based Disaster Preparedness is to create resilient people living within safer, more resilient communities within safer, more resilient environments within safer, more resilient countries. This is achieved by reducing the: Reducing the probability of failure through applying preparedness measures. Reducing the consequences of failure, in terms of", "fewer lives lost fewer injuries and reduced direct and indirect damage. Reducing time needed for recovery. Recognizing patterns of vulnerability that can develop during the process of reconstruction. Characteristics of community resilient before a disaster- Community can reduce disaster impact by adopting many approaches, such as: Using traditional experience and knowledge. Preparing for any possible hazard by having emergency kits or supplies, (buffer stocks) ready for Having family or community disaster management plans as well as improving adaptive behavior, strengthening houses, providing emergency protection of doors and windows from high winds. Organizing capacity building training courses on first aid. Evacuation plans. Permanent relocation of the community away from unsafe sites. Characteristics of community resilience during disaster: Community can cope during", "a disaster by: Drawing on the support of their community. Taking stock to determine what they have and what or who is missing. Restoring communications to facilitate aid distribution. Mitigating future risks (both psychological as well as material threats) Regarding the entire experience as a learning process. Characteristics of community resilience after disaster: The following concerns need to be addressed during the recovery process to build more resilience Plan community recovery plan that links social, physical, economic and environmental recovery. Regard physical recovery work as bereavement therapy and a possible income source and the entire reconstruction experience as a learning process. Draw on support of the community by being adaptable, flexible and patient. Where possible ensure that local labor and", "locally purchased reconstruction goods are used to revitalize the damaged local economy. Recognize the value of a prepared community who know what to do to recover. Take actions to reduce future vulnerability as the recovery proceeds. The Nature of safer and resilient communities- A resilient community is one that has certain capacities at three phases: Phase 1. The ability to absorb the shocks of hazard impact, so that they do not become disasters (thus to reduce the probability of a failure) Phase 2. The capacity to bounce back during and after disaster (thus to reduce the consequences of Phase 3. The opportunity for change adaptation following a disaster (thus to reduce the time needed for recovery as well as patterns", "of vulnerability) Indicators of a Resilient Community- Resilience is a moving target, and realistically it may not be possible for communities to achieve absolute resilience against hazards or other risk factors. However, communities can still achieve certain level of development, and they can establish institutional arrangements that would enhance their resilience. In order to assess whether a community has achieved a certain level of resilience, stakeholders need to establish some indicators, which if existed would mean that the community had achieved a minimum level of resiliency. A set of indicators is given as below. Community organization. DRR and DP plan. Community Early Warning System. Trained manpower: risk assessment, search and rescue, medical first aid, - relief distribution, masons for safer", "house construction, fire fighting. Physical Connectivity: roads, electricity, telephone, clinics. Relational connectivity with local authorities, NGOs, etc. Knowledge of risks and risk reduction actions Community Disaster Reduction Fund to implement risk reduction activities. Safer House to withstand local hazards. Safe source/s of livelihoods. 8. HAZARD, VUNLERABIITY AND CAPACITY ASSESSMENT Learning Objectives: \uf0a7 Identification of hazard, risk and vulnerability Assessment of level of risk of different components The Hazard, Vulnerability and Capacity assessment in the community is a participatory process of determining the nature, scope and magnitude of negative effects of hazards to the community and its households within an anticipated time period. It determines the likely negative effects on \u2018elements at risk\u2019 (people; household and community structures, facilities like schools", "and hospitals; livelihood and economic activities, jobs, equipment, crops, livestock etc.; lifelines, access roads and bridges) and why particular households and groups are vulnerable to specific hazards and others are not? The coping mechanisms and the resources present in the community are also identified. Hazard, Vulnerability and Capacity Assessment is participatory in nature because the affected target because the affected target populations are involved in the various stages of risk assessment. It unites the various stakeholders in the locality, most especially the community in common understanding of the Moreover, vulnerability and Capacity Assessment combines both scientific and empirical data concerning known hazards and other possible threats to the community. Although indigenous knowledge is vital, scientific data is especially important in", "a situation when the hazard has not been experienced by the The following are the components of Hazard, vulnerability and Capacity Assessment: Hazard Assessment: Hazard Assessment focuses on the existing or latent factors present in, or around the community that could potentially have a harmful effect on the community. As stated earlier in the course these may be natural (geological, hydro-meteorological and biological) or induced by human processes (environmental degradation and technological hazards). Hazards can be measured in terms of their location, intensity, frequency and probability. Particularly useful tools for hazard assessment are hazard mapping, seasonal calendar, historical visualisation and projection, semi structured interviews, transect walk, direct observation are also useful Vulnerability Assessment: Vulnerability Assessment \u2018measures\u2019 the physical, social, economic", "and environmental factors or processes, which increase the susceptibility of the community to the impact of hazards. Particularly useful tools are social vulnerability mapping, physical vulnerability mapping, and seasonal calendar; transect walk, direct observation and semi-structured interviews. Capacity Assessment: Capacity assessment \u2018measures\u2019 the strengths and resources available in and to the community and areas where these can be improved. As stated previously these may include physical, institutional, social or economic means as well as skilled personal or collective attributes such as leadership and management. Particularly useful tools for capacity assessment are resource mapping, semi- structured interviews, transect walk and direct observation. Prior to the conduct of Hazard, Vulnerability and Capacity Assessment, the most commonly used tool to assess the community", "needs is the baseline studies. The following are the most commonly used tools for hazard, vulnerability and capacity assessment. Seasonal Calendar. Historical Visualization and Projection. Semi-structured Interviews/ Focus Group Discussions. Direct Observation. Mapping: Maps facilitate communication and stimulate discussions on important issues in the community. Maps can be drawn for many topics: Social map (houses, social facilities and infrastructure, i.e., temple, school, health centre, roads, water pumps, irrigation, recreational facilities, etc.) Hazard map, elements at risk, safe areas etc. Resource map showing local capacities (Health centers, religious facilities, schools, local markets Accessibility map (route and condition of access to evacuation centre or shelter) Team and community members for mapping: village leaders who are familiar with number of houses; religious leaders,", "the elderly, people with disabilities, sectorial representatives- women, children\u2019s committee, farmers etc. Mapping can be drawn in the following ways: Decide what kind of map should be drawn. Find men and women (also children and consider vulnerable group representation) who know the area and are willing to share their experiences. Choose a suitable place (ground, floor, paper) and medium (sticks, stones, seeds, pencils, chalk) for Help the people get started but let them draw by themselves. Seasonal Calendar: Seasonal calendar showing different events, experiences, activities, conditions throughout the annual cycle. Seasonal Calendar can be design for many reasons: Identify periods of stress, hazards, diseases, hunger, vulnerability etc. Identify what people do in these periods, how they diversify sources of livelihood,", "when do they time for community activity, when do they have savings, what are the coping strategies. Identify gender specific division of work, in times of disaster and normal times. Seasonal Calendar can be design in the following ways: Use \u2018blackboard\u2019 or craft paper; mark off months of the year on the horizontal axis. Ask people to list sources of livelihood, events, conditions etc. and arrange these along with vertical axis. Ask people to enumerate all the work they do (e.g. plugging, planting, weeding etc.) for each source of livelihood/ income by marking months and duration, adding gender and age. Facilitate analyze by linking the different aspects of the calendar; how do disasters affect sources of livelihood? When workload is", "heaviest? Ask for seasonal food intake; period of food storage, out- Historical visualization and Projection: Historical visualization and projection gather information about what happened in the past and its impact Historical visualization and projection is important for the following points: To get insight and past hazards, change in their nature, intensity and behavior. Understand present situation in community. To make people aware of changes. To identify impacts of past experiences in the future. Historical visualization and projection can be design in the following ways: Plan group discussions and ensure that key-informants (old people, leaders, and teachers) are present. Invite as many people as possible, especially the young ones, for them to hear the history of their Ask people, if they", "recall major events in the community, such as; Major hazards and their effects. Changes in land use (crops, forest cover etc.) Changes in land tenure. Changes in food security and nutrition. Changes in administration and organization. Major political events. Changes in attitudes ( e.g. toward people with disability and the elderly) Semi-structured Interviews/ Focus Group Discussions: Semi-structured interviews are discussions in an informal way. They do not use a formal questionnaire but at the most a checklist of questions as a flexible guide. There are different types of semi-structured interviews- (a) Group interview (b) Focus Group Discussions (c) Individual Interview (d) Key-informant Semi-structured Interview is important because of the following reasons- To obtain community level information to have access to", "a large body of knowledge, not useful for sensitive issues. To obtain special knowledge about a particular topic, interview a farmer about cropping practices, a village leader about procedures and policies. To discuss specific topics in detail with a small group of persons who are knowledgeable or who are interested in the topic. Semi-structured Interview can be done in the following ways: Prepare key issues in advance. Select one person lead the interview. Ask questions in an open-ended ways. Ask for concrete information and examples. Try to involve different people. Transect walk is a systematic process with key-informants through the community to look out the layout of the community including distances between key places, accessibility, and land use zones, by", "observing, asking, listening and producing a transect diagram. Transect walk is important because of the following reasons- Visualizes interactions between physical environment and human activities over space and time. Identifies danger zones, evacuation sites, local resources used during emergency periods, land use Seeks problems and opportunities. Transect walk can be done in the following ways- Based on map, select a transect line. Select a group of six to ten members, who represent the cross section, and explain exposure. During walk, take time for brief and informal interviews at different places in the transect. Focus issues on proneness to particular disasters. Conduct transects walk with representatives from vulnerable groups and their families. Direct Observation: It is systematically observing objects, people, events,", "relationships, participation and recording these observations. Consider how to observe the \u2018invisible\u2019 (e.g. people with disabilities) Direct observation is important to get a better picture of the (disaster) situation, especially of things that are difficult to get across verbally. Direct observation can be done at the initial phase when you enter community and during to cross-check verbal information. Observations are analyzed afterwards (for instance how men and women participate in community meetings) 9. COMMUNITY BASED DISASTER PREPAREDNESS \u2013 PROCESS & STEP BY NGOS\u2019 Learning Objectives: To understand how community people can take the help of local resources/ NGO\u2019s for disaster Successful disaster preparedness strategies involve careful efforts to combine knowledge, technology, expertise, institutional capacities, management skills, and practical experience for", "optimum results, which would not be possible without proper collaboration between the two key players: state and civil society. The state can effectively link up knowledge, technology, skills, and resources, expertise offered by specialist institutions with grassroots experience, organizational capacity, participatory management skills, and community based initiatives of NGOs for disaster reduction. NGOs can be innovative, rooted to the ground and participatory in their approach while government can replicate best practices for larger impact. NGOs play an important role in disaster response and mitigation in different regions. Many international NGOs specifically focus on providing humanitarian aid to disaster victims. Local NGOs in South Asia have also played an active role in disaster management in recent years. In India, NGOs played", "a significant role in emergency response and rehabilitation following major disasters: the 1993 earthquake at Latur, which killed 7601 people, the 1999 Orissa super cyclone which killed 8931 people, the 2001 Gujarat earthquake which killed over 13,000 people. Apart from that cloud burst at Leh, Sikkim Earthquake, Ethnic violence at Assam where NGO\u2019s played a significant role. NGO\u2019s can play various ways in Community Based Disaster Preparedness. Disaster risk reduction process has six sequential stages, which can be implemented before a disaster occurs or after one has happened to reduce future risks. Each stage grows out of the preceding stage and leads to further action. The stages in the disaster risk reduction process are given in the figure below: Selecting", "the community Community based disaster risk management planning Rapport building and Community managed Participatory disaster risk Monitoring & Evaluation A thorough assessment of the community\u2019s vulnerabilities, coping capacities and the risks is needed to start any risk reduction activities. The active involvement of communities, subject experts and elected authorities is important in decision-making to promote ownership and sustainability. Selecting the Community The first task of NGOS\u2019s is to conduct a detailed risk assessment survey of the whole area. The selection of communities for implementation of CBDP activities depends upon a number of factors and criteria, but most importantly the risk exposure of the particular community. Given below is a list of the criteria for identifying communities for CBDP activities: \u2022", "Severity of community\u2019s exposure to risk (most vulnerable) \u2022 Number of people to benefit from Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) activities \u2022 Readiness of community to engage in Disaster Risk Reduction activities \u2022 Poverty status of the community \u2022 Governmental priority of physical, social and economic vulnerability \u2022 Budget availability All of the above mentioned criteria wouldn\u2019t be equally important in a given area. The NGO\u2019s/ Local Authorities can make decisions on the basis of factors that might be more important locally, then the others. A thorough survey will need to be conducted for the identification of vulnerable communities. The following table can be used to conduct survey for identifying the vulnerable communities for a transparent decision-making process. Table1. Community Identification", "Matrix Communities Risk Accessibility Staff Source: Participants Hand Book, Community Based Disaster Risk Management, ADPC Rapport building & Understanding: Once the most vulnerable communities are identified it would be important to understand the local social relationships and power structures, key economic groups and to build good informal relationship with the local people. This will be crucial in order to ensure participation of various local groups. The NGOs who support the community in disaster preparedness need to build a picture of the nature, needs and resources of the community. This step usually involves interacting and integrating with the community and gathering basic information to have a general description of the community. Participatory disaster risk assessment: Participatory Disaster Risk Assessment is a", "process to identify the risks that communities, villages, communes face and how people overcome those risks. This will be conducted in most vulnerable and priority communities. This process involves hazard assessment, vulnerability assessment and capacity assessment, analysis and prioritization of risks. The participatory disaster risk assessment will be conducted by the NGO\u2019s with the involvement of local people, community leaders and subject experts. Community based disaster risk management planning: At this stage, further analysis will be conducted jointly by the NGO\u2019s and communities to analyze the risks and identify strategies and solutions to address them. Based on this analysis, a detailed risk reduction and response plan will be developed for the particular communities. The planning process will involve analysis of", "local stakeholders and local resources. Roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders for implementation of activities will be clarified. Community managed implementation: The implementation of the plan should be done through the community organization at community level with support from NGO\u2019s and other technical and research institutions. The implementation process will include various structural and non-structural activities; e.g. community training, disaster response drills, community early warning systems, disaster resilient construction of houses, forest plantations, mangrove plantation, diversification of crops, rainwater harvesting, construction of dykes, bridges etc. for vulnerability reduction and hazard mitigation. The community-based organization would be responsible for overall management of the disaster reduction activities. The NGO\u2019s should play a facilitating and coordinating role for the implementation of the", "community plan and mobilization of resources. NGO\u2019s can also need to provide essential technical assistance to the communities for hazard mitigation and vulnerability reduction. Monitoring & Evaluation: Participatory monitoring and evaluation (PME) involves the local community, development agencies, NGO\u2019s, local authorities, PRI members, and other stakeholders in measuring the progress made, and identifying necessary follow-up actions. Harmony among all the groups in PME is an important factor for 10. EXTRICATION AND EVACUATION Learning Objectives: To know how to extricate patients from a variety of situations. To use scarce resources for transportation of needy patients", "11. WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE PROMOTION (WASH) Learning Objectives: To know its importance To know how it saves life To know how it reduces faecal-oral transmission of diseases Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) plays significant role in preventing water related communicable diseases during normal course of development as well as during emergency. The WASH sector deals with safe water supply, safe sanitation services and safe hygiene behavior. People\u2019s participation is the key for any successful WASH intervention and PRIs can play significant role in planning and implementing such interventions during normal course of development as well as during emergency. The main objective of water supply and sanitation programs are to reduce the transmission of faecal-oral diseases and exposure to disease-bearing", "vectors through the promotion of good hygiene practices, the provision of safe drinking water and the reduction of environmental health risks and by establishing the conditions that allow people to live with good health, dignity, comfort and security. Good Practices in WASH and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Disaster risk reduction in WASH sector relates more to the prevention or mitigation of the public health risks during and post disaster situations. Disaster risk reduction practices can emerge from both the hardware and software components of WASH. In other words, they can emerge from both the behaviour and the habits of the community and also the way the existing water and sanitation facilities are designed, installed, put into use and maintained. Good", "DRR practices need not always be complex or complicated in order to achieve effective risk reduction. Even simple behaviour changes can bring about a phenomenal transformation in the health and well being of the community, at large. It is a proven fact that hand washing at critical times of the day alone has been able to reduce the incidence of diarrhoeal diseases by more than 50%. Besides hygiene, good DRR practices also come from use and maintenance of water and sanitation facilities and more importantly the design, construction and structural repair of such facilities by PRI. Examples of good DRR practices under each category are given below: Personal hygiene based DRR practices: Practices those are inherent to the habits, customs,", "faith and behaviour which can reduce the public health risks fall under this category. Given below are some of the crucial behaviour changes that are considered best hygienic practices: Washing vegetables and fruits, especially when they are eaten raw Washing hands with cleaning agent such as soap or ash: \uf0de after defecation \uf0de before cooking, eating or feeding \uf0de after cleaning children\u2019s bottom \uf0de after safely disposing children\u2019s faeces Taking bath and keep oneself clean Use and safe disposal of sanitary napkins or any other appropriate material to ensure menstrual Good practices that involve use and maintenance of water and sanitation facilities: The purpose of water and sanitation facilities is to enable hygiene improvement in order to reduce the public", "health risks. If these facilities are not properly used or maintained then hygiene improvement is not possible. Some of the good practices that can reduce the disaster risks are: Avoiding open defecation Safe fetching of water (without making hand contact with the inside of the containers) Fetching of water from protected water source Avoiding water from contaminated sources such as surface water like streams and ponds for the purpose of drinking Safe storage of drinking water; store in a container with a lid Use of ladle for drawing water and not dipping fingers and hands into the stored water Regular maintenance of water abstraction points and sources Avoiding use of water at the abstraction point or the source Proper drainage", "of waste water at the household level and community level Proper disposal of household and community level garbage and solid waste Good practices based on structural measures for DRR Effective disaster risk reduction is possible by integrating good DRR practices in WASH interventions in all the components of WASH such as water supply, excreta disposal, drainage etc. It involves use of appropriate technology and adopting appropriate design and installation of facilities for the given conditions of topography, ground water table, soil porosity, natural geographical features like presence of water bodies, drainage channels etc. For example, leach pit type twin pit latrine is absolutely inappropriate in high ground water table areas. Construction of a hand pump in a low lying area", "is inappropriate, as it cannot be used during floods, besides chances of water contamination. Instead of a leach pit latrine technical options such as raised latrine with containment tank, septic tank system or ecological sanitation (where faecal matter is dry composted using ash or lime and urine is separated) will prove to be appropriate in high ground water table areas. Therefore, structural measures for DRR need to be designed based on the local context and integrated with the development plan of the village. These measures can be in the form of new installation, repair of existing facilities and maintenance. Some examples: Fencing or protecting existing water sources Construction of concrete apron (platform) to protect the ground water Repairing the cracks", "in the platform Construction of drain at the water abstraction point (hand pump, water tap etc) Raising the hand pump corresponding to the high flood level Construction of raised latrines Construction of incinerators for safe disposal of menstrual cloth Installation of garbage bins at specific locations Construction of drainage to avoid flooding and also deter vectors like flies and mosquitoes. Guidelines for Hand Washing Technique Hand washing, when done correctly, is an important personal hygiene practice to prevent contracting and spreading communicable diseases. When should we WASH our hands? Before touching the eyes, nose and mouth. Before eating handling food After using the toilet When hands are contaminated by respiratory secretions, e.g., after coughing and sneezing. After touching public installations", "or equipment, such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels, or door knobs. After changing diapers or handling soiled articles when looking after young children or sick. Steps for good Hand washing Wet hands under running water Apply liquid soap and rub hands together to make a soapy lather Away from the running water, rub the palms, backs of hands, between fingers, backs of fingers, thumbs, finger tips and wrists. Do this for at least 20 seconds. Rinse hands thoroughly under running water Dry hands thoroughly with a clean cotton towel, a paper towel or a hand dryer. The cleaned hands should not touch the water tap directly again. Towels should never be shared. Used paper towel should be properly disposed", "of. Personal towels to be reused must be stored properly and washed at least once daily. It is even better to have more than one towel for frequent replacement. When hands are not visibly soiled, application of 70-80% alcohol-based hand rub is equally effective for disinfection. 12. PSYCHOLOGICAL FIRST AID Learning Objectives: To identify people who require Psychological First Aid in Emergencies To know the basic steps of PFA Do\u2019s and don\u2019ts while providing PFA providing practical care and support, which does not intrude; assessing needs and concerns; helping people to address basic needs (for example, food and water, information); listening to people, but not pressuring them to talk; comforting people and helping them to feel calm; helping people connect", "to information, services and social supports; Protecting people from further harm. It is also important to understand what PFA is not: It is not something that only professionals can do. It is not \u201cpsychological debriefing\u201d in that PFA does not necessarily involve a detailed discussion of the event that caused the distress. It is not asking someone to analyze what happened to them or to put time and events in order. Although PFA involves being available to listen to people\u2019s stories, it is not about pressuring people to tell you their feelings and reactions to an event. PFA is for distressed people who have been recently exposed to a serious crisis event. You can provide help to both children and", "adults. However, not everyone who experiences a crisis event will need or want PFA. Does not force help on people who do not want it, but make yourself easily available to those who may People who need more immediate advanced support: 1. people with serious, life-threatening injuries who need emergency medical care 2. people who are so upset that they cannot care for themselves or their children 3. People who may hurt themselves 4. people who may hurt others When is PFA provided? Although people may need access to help and support for a long time after an event, PFA is aimed at helping people who have been very recently affected by a crisis event. You can provide PFA when", "you first have contact with very distressed people. This is usually during or immediately after an event. However, it may sometimes be days or weeks after, depending on how long the event lasted and how severe it was. Where is PFA provided? You can offer PFA wherever it is safe enough for you to do so. This is often in community settings, such as at the scene of an accident, or places where distressed people are served, such as health centers, shelters or camps, schools and distribution sites for food or other types of help. Ideally, try to provide PFA where you can have some privacy to talk with the person when appropriate. For people who have been exposed to", "certain types of crisis events, such as sexual violence, privacy is essential for confidentiality and to respect the person\u2019s dignity. Respect safety, dignity and rights: When you take on the responsibility to help in situations where people have been affected by a distressing event, it is important to act in ways that respect the safety, dignity and rights of the people you are helping. The following principles apply to any person or agency involved in humanitarian response, including those who provide PFA: Respect people\u2019s\u2026 Avoid putting people at further risk of harm as a result of your actions. Make sure, to the best of your ability, that the adults and children you help are safe and protect them from physical", "or psychological harm. Treat people with respect and according to their cultural and social norms. Make sure people can access help fairly and without discrimination. Help people to claim their rights and access available support. Act only in the best interest of any person you encounter. Be honest and trustworthy Don\u2019t exploit your relationship as a helper Respect people\u2019s right to make their own Don\u2019t ask the person for any money or favour for helping them Be aware of and set aside your own biases and Don\u2019t make false promises or give false Make it clear to people that even if they refuse help now, they can still access help in the Don\u2019t exaggerate your skills Respect privacy and keep", "the person\u2019s story confidential, if this is appropriate Don\u2019t force help on people, and don\u2019t be intrusive or pushy Behave appropriately by considering the person\u2019s culture, age and gender Don\u2019t pressure people to tell you their story Don\u2019t share the person\u2019s story with others Don\u2019t judge the person for their actions or Good Communication \u2013 Being calm and showing understanding can help people in distress feel more safe and secure, understood, respected and cared for appropriately. Things to say and do \u2013 Try to find a quiet place to talk, and minimize outside distractions. Respect privacy and keep the person\u2019s story confidential, if this is appropriate. Stay near the person but keep an appropriate distance depending on their age, gender", "and culture. Let them know you are listening; for example, nod your head or say \u201chmmmm\u2026.\u201d Be patient and calm. Provide factual information, if you have it. Be honest about what you know and don\u2019t know. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I will try to find out about that for you.\u201d Give information in a way the person can understand \u2013 keep it simple. Acknowledge how they are feeling and any losses or important events they tell you about, such as loss of their home or death of a loved one. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I can imagine this is very sad for you.\u201d Acknowledge the person\u2019s strengths and how they have helped themselves. Allow for silence. Things NOT to say and", "do \u2013 Don\u2019t pressure someone to tell their story. Don\u2019t interrupt or rush someone\u2019s story (for example, don\u2019t look at your watch or speak too Don\u2019t touch the person if you\u2019re not sure it is appropriate to do so. Don\u2019t judge what they have or haven\u2019t done, or how they are feeling. Don\u2019t say: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t feel that way,\u201d or \u201cYou should feel lucky you survived.\u201d Don\u2019t make up things you don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t use terms that are too technical. Don\u2019t tell them someone else\u2019s story. Don\u2019t talk about your own troubles. Don\u2019t give false promises or false reassurances. \u00bb\u00bb Don\u2019t think and act as if you must solve all the person\u2019s problems for them. Don\u2019t take away the person\u2019s", "strength and sense of being able to care for themselves. Don\u2019t talk about people in negative terms (for example, don\u2019t call them \u201ccrazy\u201d or \u201cmad\u201d). Action principles of PFA: There are three action principles of PFA \u2013 look, listen and link Check for safety. Check for people with obvious urgent basic needs. Check for people with serious distress reactions. Important message What dangers can you see in the environment, such as active conflict, damaged roads, unstable buildings or Can you be there without likely harm to yourself or others? If you are not certain about the safety of the crisis site, then do not go. Try to get help for people in need. If possible, communicate with people in distress", "from a safe distance. Does anyone appear to be critically injured and in need of emergency Does anyone seem to need rescuing, such as people trapped or in immediate Does anyone have obvious urgent basic needs, such as protection from the weather, torn clothing? Which people may need help in terms of accessing basic services and special discrimination and violence? Who else is available around me to Know your role and try to get help for people who need special assistance or who have obvious urgent basic needs. Refer critically injured people to medical personnel or others trained in physical first aid. Are there people who appear extremely upset, not able to move on their own, not responding to others,", "or in shock? Where and who are the most distressed Consider who may benefit from PFA and how you can best help. People may react in various ways to a crisis. Some examples of distress responses to crisis are listed below: Physical symptoms (for example, shaking, headaches, feeling very tired, loss of appetite, aches and Crying, sadness, depressed mood, grief Being \u201con guard\u201d or \u201cjumpy\u201d Worry that something really bad is going to happen Insomnia, nightmares Irritability, anger Guilt, shame (for example, for having survived, or for not helping or saving others) Confused, emotionally numb, or feeling unreal or in a daze Appearing withdrawn or very still (not moving) Not responding to others, not speaking at all Disorientation (for example,", "not knowing their own name, where they are from, or what happened) Not being able to care for themselves or their children (for example, not eating or drinking, not able to make simple decisions) Some people may only be mildly distressed or not distressed at all. Most people will recover well over time, especially if they can restore their basic needs and receive support such as help from those around them Approach people who may need support. Ask about people\u2019s needs and concerns. Listen to people, and help them to feel calm. Listening properly to people you are helping is essential to understand their situation and needs, to help them to feel calm, and to be able to offer appropriate", "help. Learn to listen with your: Eyes \u2013 Giving the person your undivided attention Ears \u2013 Truly hearing their concerns Heart \u2013 With caring and showing respect Approach people who may need support: Approach people respectfully and according to their culture. Introduce yourself by name and organization. Ask if you can provide help. If possible, find a safe and quiet place to talk. Help the person feel comfortable; for example, offer water if you can. Try to keep the person safe. Remove the person from immediate danger, if it is safe to do so. Try to protect the person from exposure to the media for their privacy and dignity. If the person is very distressed, try to make sure they", "are not alone. Ask about people\u2019s needs and concerns: Although some needs may be obvious, such as a blanket or covering for someone whose clothing is torn, always ask what people need and what their concerns are. Find out what is most important to them at this moment, and help them work out what their Listen to people and help them to feel calm: Stay close to the person. Do not pressure the person to talk. Listen in case they want to talk about what happened. If they are very distressed, help them to feel calm and try to make sure they are not alone. Help people address basic needs and access services. Help people cope with problems. Give information.", "Connect people with loved ones and social support. Basic needs, such as shelter, food, and water and sanitation. Health services for injuries or help with chronic (long-term) medical conditions. Understandable and correct information about the event, loved ones and available services. Being able to contact loved ones, friends and other social supports. Access to specific support related to one\u2019s culture or religion. Being consulted and involved in important decisions. Ending your help When and how you stop providing help will depend on the context of the crisis, your role and situation, and the needs of the people you are helping. Use your best judgment of the situation, the person\u2019s needs and your own needs. If appropriate, explain to the person", "that you are leaving, and if someone else will be helping them from that point on, try and introduce them to that person. If you have linked the person with other services, let them know what to expect and be sure they have the details to follow up. No matter what your experience has been with the person, you can say goodbye in a positive way by wishing them.", "The perception about disaster and its management has undergone a change following the enactment of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The definition of disaster is now all encompassing, which includes not only the events emanating from natural and man-made causes, but even those events which are caused by accident or negligence. There was a long felt need to capture information about all such events occurring across the sectors and efforts made to mitigate them in the country and to collate them at one place in a global perspective. This book has been an effort towards realising this thought.

For example, disasters caused by floods, droughts, tidal waves and earth tremors are generally considered \u201cnatural disasters.\u201d Disasters caused by chemical or industrial accidents, environmental pollution, transport accidents and political unrest are classified as \u201chuman-made\u201d or \u201chuman- induced\u201d disasters since they are the direct result of human action. 1.1.2 A more modern and social understanding of disasters, however, views this distinction as artificial since most disasters result from the action or inaction of people and their social and economic structures. This happens by people living in ways that degrade", "their environment, developing and over populating urban centres, or creating and perpetuating social and economic systems. Communities and population settled in areas susceptible to the impact of a raging river or the violent tremors of the earth are placed in situations of high vulnerability because of their socio-economic conditions. This is compounded by every aspect of nature being subject to seasonal, annual and sudden fluctuations and also due to the unpredictability of the timing, frequency and magnitude of occurrence of the disasters. The word \u2018Disaster\u2019 derives from Middle French d\u00e9sastre1 and that from Old Italian disastro, which in turn comes from the Greek pejorative prefix \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3-, (dus-) \u201cbad\u201d+ \u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 (aster), \u201cstar\u201d. The root of the word disaster2 (\u201cbad star\u201d in", "Greek and Latin) comes from an astrological theme in which the ancients used to refer to the destruction or deconstruction of a star as a disaster. 1.3.1 Disaster is an event or series of events, which gives rise to casualties and damage or loss of properties, infrastructures, environment, essential services or means of livelihood on such a scale which is beyond the normal capacity of the affected community to cope with. Disaster is also sometimes described as a \u201ccatastrophic situation in which the normal pattern of life or eco-system has been disrupted and extra-ordinary emergency interventions are required to save and preserve lives and or the environment\u201d. 1.3.2 The Disaster Management Act, 2005 defines disaster as \u201ca catastrophe, mishap, calamity", "or grave occurrence in any area, arising from natural or man made causes, or by accident or negligence which results in substantial loss of life or human suffering or damage to, and destruction of, property, or damage to, or degradation of, environment, and is of such a nature or magnitude as to be beyond the coping capacity of the community of the affected area\u201d. 1.3.3 The United Nations defines disaster as \u201cthe occurrence of sudden or major misfortune which disrupts the basic fabric and normal functioning of the society or community\u201d. 1.4 Disasters not new to Mankind 1.4.1 Disasters are not new to mankind. They have been the constant, though inconvenient, companions of the human beings since time immemorial. Disasters", "can be natural or human- made. Earthquake, cyclone, hailstorm, cloud-burst, landslide, soil erosion, snow avalanche, Disaster Management in India flood etc. are the examples of natural disasters while fire, epidemics, road, air, rail accidents and leakages of chemicals/ nuclear installations etc. fall under the category of human-made disasters. The High Power Committee on Disaster Management, constituted in 1999, has identified 31 various disasters categorized into five major sub-groups which are given in Box 1.1. Box 1.1: List of various Disasters Water and climate related Floods and drainage management Tornadoes and hurricanes Heat wave and cold wave Thunder and lightening Geological related disasters Landslides and mudflows Dam failures/ Dam bursts Chemical, industrial and nuclear related disasters Chemical and industrial disasters Nuclear", "disasters Accident related disasters Major building collapse Serial bomb blasts Festival related disasters Electrical disasters and fires Air, road and rail accidents Biological related disasters Biological disasters and epidemics Cattle epidemics Source: High Powered Committee Report-1999 Note: After 2004, Tsunami has also been included in the list of disasters. The mechanism for preparing a database for different kinds of disasters happening across the country is yet to be developed. National Institute for Disaster Management (NIDM), under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 has been tasked with research work and it is expected that it would develop a mechanism to capture such data on the disasters including its impact on socio- economic life of the nation and GDP growth. At the global", "level, the three main sources which have been collecting the data are EM-DAT, Natcat and Sigma. EM-DAT is the acronym for data that the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology on Disasters (CRED) has been collecting from the countries since 1987 (going back to 1900). Munich Reinsurance Company maintains Natcat and Swiss Reinsurance Company maintains Sigma. The authenticity of the data collected by these agencies varies and the figures given by them do not necessarily attest to any comprehensive data and may be exaggerated sometimes which was realized in the case of the report given in respect of 1999 landslides in Venezuela3. 1.5.1 Lack of Central Statistical database as a record of past disasters is a major constraint for risk", "assessment and compilation of disaster history in the country. Different sources of data have different figures of casualties and impacts, thereby hindering an objective assessment. Scientific data on major hazards are available but information on vulnerabilities are scattered in multiple places and often such data are not available uniformly for the entire country. 1.5.2 Disaster information available from different sources are yet to be regularly assessed by common public as well as other stakeholders. Lack of awareness about available resources is a reason for lack of last mile reach of the available information. 1.5.3 In India, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation have taken initiatives for collection of data in respect of different disasters. A Technical Committee was constituted by", "the Central Statistics Office with a view to prepare a framework for disaster statistics for developing a database on disaster and related aspects. Five formats have been developed for capturing the information about (i) Statistics on disaster at district level, (ii) Statistics on relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction at district level, (iii) District wise compilation of statistics on disaster, (iv) District- wise compilation of statistics on relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction and (v) Aggregation of damage and relief data at state level. The state Government and District level institutions would be required to furnish this information for preparing the data base at centralized level.

Disasters \u2013 Global Scenario4 1.6.1 Disasters - natural or human-made are common throughout the world. Disasters continue to occur without warning and are perceived to be on an increase in their magnitude, complexity, frequency and economic impact. Hazards pose threats to people and assume serious proportions in the under developed countries with dense population. During the second half of the 20th century, more than 200 worst natural disasters occurred in the different parts of", "the world and claimed lives of around 1.4 million people. Losses due to natural disasters are 20 times greater (as % of GDP) in the developing countries than in industrialized one. Asia tops the list of casualties due to natural disasters. Figure 1.1 shows the Regional distribution of disasters by type, as prepared by Centre for Research on Epidemiology of Disaster. 1.6.2 There have been several natural, as well as, man-made disasters. Records of natural disasters can be traced way back to 430 B.C. when the Typhus epidemic was reported in Athens. Ten deadliest natural disasters recorded in the world are dated back to 1556 when an earthquake in Shaanxi province of China occurred on 23rd January, 1556 and 8,30,000", "casualties were recorded.

During this period of 30 years the country has been hit by approximately 25 major disasters apart from the heat wave, cold wave and heavy winds affecting some areas of the country. Figure 1.7: Major Disasters in India from 1980-2010 1.7. Vulnerability Profile of India 1.7.1 India has been vulnerable, in varying degrees, to a large number of natural, as well as, human-made disasters on account", "of its unique geo-climatic and socio-economic conditions. It is highly vulnerable to floods, droughts, cyclones, earthquakes, landslides, avalanches and forest fires. Out of 35 states and union territories in the country, 27 of them are disaster prone. Almost 58.6 per cent of the landmass is prone to earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity; over 40 million hectares (12 per cent of land) are prone to floods and river erosion; of the 7,516 km long coastline, close to 5,700 km is prone to cyclones and tsunamis; 68 per cent of the cultivable area is vulnerable to drought and hilly areas are at risk from landslides and avalanches. A multi-hazard map of India may be seen in Figure 1.8. Hazard Profile", "of India (a) India is one of the ten worst disaster prone countries of the world. The country is prone to disasters due to number of factors; both natural and human induced, including adverse geo climatic conditions, topographic features, environmental degradation, population growth, urbanisation, industrialization, non scientific development practices etc. The factors either in original or by accelerating the intensity and frequency of disasters are responsible for heavy toll of human lives and disrupting the life supporting system in the country. The basic reason for the high vulnerability of the country to natural disasters is its unique geographical and geological situations. As far as the vulnerability to disaster is concerned, the five distinctive regions of the country i.e. Himalayan region,", "the alluvial plains, the hilly part of the peninsula, and the coastal zone have their own specific problems. While on one hand the Himalayan region is prone to disasters like earthquakes and landslides, the plain is affected by floods almost every year. The desert part of the country is affected by droughts and famine while the coastal zone susceptible to cyclones and storms. (b) The natural geological setting of the country is the primary basic reason for its increased vulnerability. The geo-tectonic features of the Himalayan region and adjacent alluvial plains make the region susceptible to earthquakes, landslides, water erosion etc. Though peninsular India is considered to be the most stable portions, but occasional earthquakes in the region shows that", "geo- tectonic movements are still going on within its depth. (c) The tectonic features, characteristics of the Hiamalya are prevalent in the alluvial plains of Indus, Ganga and Brahmputra too, as the rocks lying below the alluvial pains are just extension of the Himalayan ranges only. Thus this region is also quite prone to seismic activities. As a result of various major river systems flowing from Himalaya and huge quantity of sediment brought by them, the area is also suffering from river channel siltation, resulting into frequent floods, especially in the plains of Uttar Pardesh and Bihar. (d) The western part of the country, including Rajasthan, Gujarat and some parts of Maharashtra are hit very frequently by drought situation. If", "Monsoon worsens the situation spreads in other parts of the country too. The disturbance in the pressure conditions over oceans, results into cyclones in coastal regions. The geo tectonic movements going on in the ocean floor make the coastal region prone to tsunami disaster too. (e) The extreme weather conditions, huge quantity of ice and snow stored in the glaciers etc. are other natural factors which make the country prone to various forms of disasters. (f) Along with the natural factors discussed in the preceding text, various human induced activities like increasing demographic pressure, deteriorating environmental conditions, Disaster Management in India Figure 1.8 : Multi Hazard Map of India Source: DM unit, UNDP, India deforestation, unscientific development, faulty agricultural practices", "and grazing, unplanned urbanisation, construction of large dams on river channels etc. are also responsible for accelerated impact and increase in frequency of disasters in the country. Losses due to disasters have been shown in Figure 1.9. It shows that economic loss is accounted for 2% of the GDP due to disasters as per the study of the World Bank. 1.7.2 Vulnerability to disasters or emergencies of Chemical, Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) origin has increased on account of socio-economic development. Heightened vulnerabilities to disaster risks can be related to expanding population, urbanization and industrialization, development within high-risk zones, environmental degradation and climate change. During the last two decades of the 19th century (1982-2001), natural disasters in India had claimed", "a total death toll of around 1, 07,813 people (on an average more than 5,390 death toll every year). As mentioned above, India with its extended coast line is exposed to five to six tropical cyclones on an average, both from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal annually. 1.7.3 Climate Change: This is evident from the increase in the global average air and ocean temperatures, precipitation and melting of snow and ice, storms/ storm surges/coastal flooding and rising global mean sea level, as recorded in the fourth Assessment Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is expected to increase the Figure 1.9: INDIA - Losses due to Disasters Losses in thousand crore Economic loss - 2% (Source :World Bank) Figure", "1.10: IPCC estimates of climate change Disaster Management in India frequency and intensity of current extreme weather events and give rise to new vulnerabilities with differential spatial and socio-economic impacts on communities. The unprecedented increase is expected to have severe impacts on the hydrological cycle, water resource, droughts, flood, drinking water, forest and ecosystems, sea level/coastal area losses of coastal wetlands and mangroves, food security, health and other related areas. The impact would be particularly disastrous for developing countries, including India and further degrade the resilience of poor, vulnerable communities, which make up between one quarter and one half of the population of the most Indian cities. 1.7.4 Reason for concern: There is clear evidence that the observed change in", "surface temperature, rainfall, evaporation and extreme events and climate change is a significant environmental challenge. The main impact of global climate change will be felt due to changes in climate variability and weather extremes. Observations during the last decade and projections indicate that extreme events i.e. heat waves, cold waves, more floods, more droughts, more intense cyclones and flash floods will increase. Extreme rainfall has substantially increased over large areas, particularly over the west coast and west central India. There is thus an urgent need for a paradigm shift in disaster management, especially under changing climate. 1.7.5 Poverty and disaster vulnerability: Poverty and risk to disasters are inextricably linked and mutually reinforcing. The poor section of the society is worst", "affected in case of disaster. The situation further aggravates due to the compulsion of the poor to exploit environmental resources for their survival, increasing the risk and exposure of the society to disasters, in particular those triggered by flood, drought and landslides. Poverty also compels the poor to migrate and live at physically more vulnerable locations, often on unsafe land and in unsafe shelters. These inhabitations of the poor at such locations are either due to the fact that there is no other land available at reasonable cost or it is close to the employment opportunities. The inhabitations of the poor people on marginal land are prone to all types of disasters. The type of construction of these houses further", "deteriorates the condition. These dwellings made up of low cost material without giving much consideration to technical aspect are easy targets of various hazards. 1.8. Climate Profile5 1.8.1 India is home to an extraordinary variety of climatic regions, ranging from tropical in the south to temperate and alpine in the Himalayan north. The nation\u2019s climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar deserts. For the purpose of identification of drought prone areas by Central Water Commission (CWC) the criteria adopted was that \u201cdrought is a situation occurring in an area when the annual rainfall is less than 75 percent of normal in 20 percent of the years examined. Any block or equivalent unit where 30 percent or more", "of the cultivated area is irrigated is considered to have reached a stage, which enables it to sustain a reasonable protection against drought\u201d. A study rainfall data from 1875 to 1998 indicated the percentage area of the country affected by moderate and severe drought. It may be noted that during the complete 124 year period there were three occasions i.e. 1877, 1899 and 1918 when percentage of the country affected by drought was more than 60 percent). 1.8.2 In the span of 124 years, the probability of occurrence of drought was found maximum in Rajasthan (25 %), Saurastra & Kutch (23%), followed by Jammu & Kashmir (21%) and Gujarat (21%) region. The drought of 1987 in various parts of the", "country was of \u201cunprecedented intensity\u201d resulting in serious crop damages and an alarming scarcity of drinking water. 1.8.3 Rainfall in India: The country is influenced by two seasons of rains, accompanied by seasonal reversal of winds from January to July. Consequent to the intense heat of the summer months, the northern Indian landmass becomes hot and draws moist winds over the oceans causing a reversal of the winds over the region called the summer or the south-west (SW) monsoon. This is most important feature controlling the Indian climate because about 75 percent of the annual rainfall is received during a short span of four months ie June to September. There is a large variation in the amounts of rainfall received", "at different locations. The average annual rainfall is less than 13 cm over the western Rajasthan, while Mausiram in the Meghalaya has as much as 1141 cm. During the period from 1871 to 2009, there were 27 major drought years in India. One of the major reasons for these droughts has been a strong link with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) patterns and its linkages with Indian food grain production. 1.8.4 South West Monsoon: The rainfall over India has large spatial as well as temporal variability. A homogeneous data series has been constructed for the period 1901-2003. Mean monthly rainfall during July (286.5 mm) is the highest and contributes about 24.2 percent of the annual rainfall (1182.8 mm). The mean", "rainfall during August is slightly lower and contributes 21.2 percent of the annual rainfall. June and September rainfalls are almost similar and contribute 13.8 percent and 14.2 percent of the annual rainfall, respectively. The mean south-west monsoon (June, July, August and September) rainfall (877.2 mm) contributes 74.2 percent of the annual rainfall (1182.8 mm). 1.8.5 The onset of the SW monsoon normally starts over the Kerala coast, the southern tip of the country by 1st June, advances along the Konkan coast in early June and covers the whole country by middle of July. Onset occurs about a week earlier over islands in the Bay of Bengal. The monsoon is influenced by global and local phenomenon like EI Nino, northern hemisphere", "temperature, sea surface temperatures, snow cover etc. The monsoon rainfall oscillates between active spells associated with widespread rains over most parts of the country. Heavy rainfall in the mountainous catchment under \u2018break\u2019 conditions result in flooding of the plains. 1.8.6 Cyclonic systems of low pressure called \u2018monsoon depressions\u2019 are formed in the Bay of Bengal during this season. These systems generally form in the northern part of the Bay with average frequency of about two to three per month and move in a northward or north- westward direction, bringing well distributed rainfall over the central and northern parts of the country. The SW monsoon generally starts withdrawing from Rajasthan by 1st September and from north-western part of India by 15th", "September. It withdraws from almost all parts of the country by 15th October. It is replaced by a northerly continental airflow called North-East Monsoon. The retreating monsoon winds cause occasional showers along the east coast of 1.8.7 North East Monsoon: Post- monsoon or Northeast monsoon or Retreating SW Monsoon Season (October, November and December): North- East monsoon or post monsoon season is a transition season associated with the establishment of the north-easterly wind regime over the Indian sub continent. Meteorological subdivisions of coastal Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and South Interior Karnataka receive good amounts of rainfall accounting for about 35 percent of their annual total rainfall in these months. Many parts of this region are affected due to the", "storms forming in the Bay of Bengal. Large scale losses to life and property occur due to heavy rainfall, strong winds and storm surges in the coastal region. Disaster Management in India 1.9 Cause and Effect of Disasters6 1.9.1 India is vulnerable to extreme weather events (Box 1.2). Over the decade of the 1990s, both the number and severity of such events have increased. Weather events can be classified as extreme on the basis of various factors such as the impact, the socio-economic losses, environmental degradation and long term damages etc. 1.9.2 With more than 70 percent of India\u2019s population relying on agriculture directly or indirectly, the impact of extreme weather on human life and other living beings. is critical.", "In the state of Orissa, 49 years have experienced floods, 30 have had droughts, and 11 faced cyclones. These analyses have yielded a 30-year cyclicity of the Indian monsoons. Droughts were more common in the 1960s. Of the 14 major drought years in the 85-year record, eight occurred in the first 30 year period (1891-1920) whereas there was only one in the second 30 year period (1921- 1950). In the 25-year period from 1951 \u20131981, five major drought years were recorded. In 1972 and 1979 deficient rainfall (about 25% below normal) was recorded in one half to two thirds of India\u2019s plains. In 1994, monsoon rainfall was deficient (between 20% and 43%) in 10 of the 31 meteorological subdivisions of", "India. 1.9.3 According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), data of major natural disasters/ extremes that occurred around the world during the period 1963-2002, indicates that floods and droughts cause the maximum damage as shown in Table 1.6. Table 1.6: Worldwide view of damage caused by Natural disasters Type of natural disaster around the world Damage caused by natural calamities (%) Tropical Cyclones Source: World Meteorological Organisation 1.9.4 Floods and droughts occurring in India are closely associated with the nature and extent of the summer monsoon. The inter-annual fluctuations in the summer monsoon rainfall over India are sufficiently large to cause devastating floods or serious droughts. Floods and droughts affect vast areas of the country, transcending state boundaries. One-sixth area", "of the country is drought-prone. Out of 40 million hectares of the flood prone area in the country, on an average, floods affect an area of around 7.5 million hectares per year.

A prolonged period of relatively dry weather leading to drought is a widely recognized climate anomaly. Drought can be devastating as water supplies dry up, crops fail to grow, animals die, and malnutrition and ill health become widespread The environmental effects of drought, including stalinization of soil and groundwater decline, increased pollution of freshwater ecosystems and regional extinction of animal species. The details of the drought years may be seen from the Table 1.7. Table 1.7: Drought years with percentage area of the country affected by drought Moderate drought (%) Severe drought (%) Disaster Management in India In India", "around 68 percent of the country is prone to drought in varying degrees. Of the entire area 35 percent receives rain falls between 750 mm and 1125 mm which is considers drought prone while 33 percent which receives rainfalls between less than 750 mm is considered to be chronically drought prone. 1.11.1 Flood destructions have always brought miseries to numerous people, especially in rural areas. Flood results in the outbreak of serious epidemics, specially malaria and cholera. Simultaneously, scarcity of water also arises. It has a drastic effect on agricultural produce. Sometimes, water remains standing over large areas for long span of time hampering the Rabi crops. The flood hazard map of India may be seen in the Figure 1.11.", "1.11.2 India is one of the most flood prone countries in the world. The principal reasons for flood lie in the very nature of natural ecological systems in this country, namely, the monsoon, the highly silted river systems and the steep and highly erodible mountains, particularly those of the Himalayan ranges. The average rainfall in India is 1150 mm with significant variation across the country. The annual rainfall along the western coast and Western Ghats, Khasi hills and over most of the Brahmaputra valley amounts to more than 2500 mm. Most of the floods occur during the monsoon period and are usually associated with tropical storms or depressions, active monsoon conditions and break monsoon situations. 1.11.3 Twenty-three of the 35", "states and union territories in the country are subject to floods and 40 million hectares of land, roughly one-eighth of the country\u2019s geographical area, is prone to floods. The National Flood Control Program was launched in the country in 1954. Since then sizeable progress has been made in the flood protection measures. By 1976, nearly one third of the flood prone area had been afforded reasonable protection; considerable experience has been gained in planning, implementation and performance of flood warning, protection and control measures (CWC, 2007).

The main causes of floods are heavy rainfall, inadequate capacity of rivers to carry the high flood discharge, inadequate drainage to carry away the rainwater quickly to streams/ rivers. Ice jams or landslides blocking streams; typhoons and cyclones also cause floods. Flash floods occur due to high rate of water flow as also due", "to poor permeability of the soil. Areas with hardpan just below the surface of the soil are more prone to, floods as water fails to seep down to the deeper layers. Mumbai Flood in 2006- Urban Flooding 1.11.5 Vulnerability to floods and other natural disasters is caused by the high population density, widespread poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, enormous pressure on rural land, and an economy traditionally dominated by agriculture. Children and women are particularly vulnerable. Eighty- five percent of the deaths during disasters are of women and children (Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, CRED 2000). Presently there is an inadequate level of protection in the country against floods. Though non-structural measures improve the preparedness to floods and reduce", "losses, the necessity of structural measures would always remain to reduce the extent of physical damage caused by floods. In future, programme, flood control and management planning along with climate change need to be integrated into development planning for the 1.12 Tropical Cyclones9 1.12.1 The major natural disaster that affects the coastal regions of India is cyclone and as India has a coastline of about 7516 kms, it is exposed to nearly 10 percent of the world\u2019s tropical cyclones. About 71 percent of this area is in ten states (Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal). The islands of Andaman, Nicobar and Lakshadweep are also prone to cyclones. On an average, about five", "or six tropical cyclones form in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian sea and hit the coast every year. Out of these, two or three are severe. 1.12.2 When a cyclone approaches to coast, a risk of serious loss or damage arises from severe winds, heavy rainfall, storm surges and river floods. The effect of a storm surge is most pronounced in wide and shallow bays exposed to cyclones such as in the northern part of Bay of Bengal. On an average, five or six tropical cyclones occur every year, of which two or three could be severe. Most cyclones occur in the Bay of Bengal followed by those in the Arabian Sea and the ratio is approximately 4:1.

However, the trend indicates a slight decrease with time. The annual average of", "cyclonic disturbances in the North Indian Ocean is about 15.7 with a standard deviation of 3.1. The annual number of cyclonic disturbances range from seven in 1984 to twenty three in 1927. The annual average of tropical cyclones has varied from one in 1949 to ten in 1893, 1926, 1930 and 1976. The Cyclone hazard map of India may be seen in the Figure 1.12. gives the vulnerability map of hazard due to cyclone. 1.12.4 A severe super cyclonic storm with winds of upto 250 km/hour crossed the coast in Orissa on October 29, 1999.

Table 1.11 gives the details of the death due to the heat waves in India. 1.14 Cold Wave and Fog11 1.14.1 Occurrences of extreme low temperature in association with incursion of dry cold winds from north into the sub continent are known as cold waves. The northern parts of India, specially the hilly regions and the adjoining plains, are influenced by transient disturbances in the mid latitude westerlies which often have weak frontal characteristics. These are known as western disturbances. The cold waves mainly affect the areas to the north of 20\u00b0N but in association with large amplitude troughs, cold wave conditions are sometimes reported from states like Maharashtra and", "Karnataka as well. Table 1.12 gives the frequencies of the occurrence of cold waves in different parts of the country for different periods. In recent years due to deterioration of the air quality in urban locations of India the deaths and discomfort from cold waves have been substantial. UP and Bihar rank the highest in terms of casualties from cold wave and this could be due to poor level of development and lack of shelters to the outdoor workers and farmers.

While the southernmost part of the country is free from dust storms and hailstorms, such hazardous weather affects the central, northeastern, north and northwestern parts of the country. The hailstorm frequencies are highest in the Assam valley, followed by hills of Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Vidarbha Maharashtra (Philip & Daniel 1976).

Earthquakes over 5.5 magnitude on the Richter scale are progressively damaging to property and human life. However, there are many other factors that influences the damage pattern. Massive earthquakes generally occur near the junction of two tectonic plates, e.g., along the Himalayan range, where the Indian plate goes below Eurasian plate. The Indian sub- continent situated on the boundaries of two continental plates is very prone to earthquakes. Some of the most", "intense earthquakes of the world have occurred in India. Fortunately, none of these have occurred in any of the major cities. According to latest seismic zoning map brought out by the Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS), over 65 percent of the country is prone to earthquake of intensity Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (MSK) VII or more. 1.16.2 India has been divided into four seismic zones according to the maximum intensity of earthquake expected (Figure 1.13). Of these, zone V is the most active which comprises of whole of Northeast India, the northern portion of Bihar, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, J&K, Gujarat and Andaman & Nicobar Islands. India has highly populous cities and the constructions in these cities are not earthquake resistant.", "Regulatory mechanisms are weak, thus any earthquake striking in one of these cities would turn into a major disaster. Six major earthquakes have struck different parts of India over a span of the last 15 years. 1.16.3 The entire Himalayan Region is considered to be vulnerable to high intensity earthquakes of a magnitude exceeding 8.0 on the Richter Scale, and in a relatively short span of about 50 years, four such major earthquakes have occurred in the region: Shillong, 1897 (M8.7); Kangra, 1905 Figure 1.13: Earthquake hazard map of India Disaster Management in India Damaged structure due to earthquake- Gujarat 2001 (M.8.0); Bihar\u2013Nepal, 1934 (M 8.3); and Assam\u2013Tibet, 1950 (M 8.6).

Landslides are also common in the Nilgiri range. It is estimated that 30 percent of the world\u2019s landslides occur in the Himalayas. The Himalayan mountains, which constitute the youngest and most dominating mountain system in the world, are not a", "single long landmass but comprises a series of seven curvilinear parallel folds running along a grand arc for a total of 3400 kilometers. Due to its unique nature, the Himalayas have a history of landslides that has no comparison with any other mountain range in the world. Landslides are also common in western ghat. In the Nilgiris, in 1978 alone, unprecedented rains in the region triggered about one hundred landslides which caused severe damage to communication lines, tea gardens and other cultivated crops. A valley in Nilgiris is called \u201cAvalanches Valley\u201d. Scientific observation in north Sikkim and Garhwal regions in the Himalayas clearly reveal that there is an average of two landslides per sq. km. The mean rate of land", "loss is to the tune of 120 meter per km per year and annual soil loss is about 2500 tones per sq km. Fig 1.14 shows the landslide hazard zones in India 1.17.2 Landslides constitute a major natural hazard in our country, which accounts for considerable loss of life and damage to communication routes, human settlements, agricultural fields and forest lands. Based on the general experience with landslides, a rough estimate of monetary loss is of the order of ` 100 crore to ` 150 crore per annum at the current prices for the country as a whole.

A tsunami (in Japanese \u2018tsu\u2019 means harbor and \u2018nami\u2019 means wave) is a series of water waves caused by the displacement of a large volume of a body of water, usually an ocean. In the Tamil language it is known as \u201cAazhi Peralai\u201d. Seismicity generated tsunamis are result of abrupt deformation of sea floor resulting vertical displacement of", "the overlying water. Earthquakes occurring beneath the sea level, the water above the reformed area is displaced from its equilibrium position. The release of energy produces tsunami waves which have small amplitude but a very long wavelength (often hundreds of kilometer long). It may be caused by non-seismic event also such as a landslide or impact of a meteor. 1.19.2 Characteristics: Tsunami in the deep ocean may have very long waves length of hundred of kilometer and travels at about 800 km per hour, but an amplitude of only about 1 km. It remains undetected by ships in the deep sea. However when it approaches the coast its wavelength diminishes but amplitude grows enormously, and it takes very little time", "to reach its full height. Computer model can provide tsunami arrival, usually within minutes of the arrival time. Tsunamis have great erosion potential, stripping the destruction of houses and coastal 1.19.3 Tsunami Vulnerability16: Potential Tsunamigenic zones may be seen from Figure 1.15. For Tsunami to hit the Indian coast according to INCOIS, it is necessary that the earthquake of magnitude more than 7.0 on Richter scale should normally occur. The possible zones for such an event to occur are Andaman - Sumatra or Makran (Pakistan). Not all the major eqrthquakes are Tsunamigenic. Few historical events to Tsunami in India may be seen in Box No. 1.3. Box 1. 4: Tsunami in Indian Ocean The Tsunami of 26th December 2004 caused", "extensive damage to life and property in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, UTs of Puducherry and Andman & Nicobar Islands (A & NI). The Tsunami disaster had badly affected the fishermen community who not only lost their near and dear ones but also lost their means of livelihood. A population of 26.63 lakhs in 1396 villages in five states and UTs was affected by this disaster. Almost 9395 people lost their lives and 3964 people were reported missing and feared dead. Most of the missing persons were from Andaman & Nicobar Islands.

The east and west coasts of India and the island regions are likely to be affected by Tsunamis generated mainly by subduction zone related earthquakes from the two potential source regions, viz., the Andaman-Nicobar-Sumatra Island Arc and the Makran subduction zone north of Arabian Sea. Depending upon the location of the Earthquake, the response time for evacuation of coastal population could range between 10 minutes to a few hours (Figure 1.16). Tsunami modeling studies indicate that the least response time available is for the Andaman & Nicobar Islands which are situated right on the subduction zones capable of triggering tsunamigenic earthquakes. Considering that a credible worst case earthquake of 7.5 or higher occurs", "near Nicobar, the Figure 1.15: Potential Tsunamigenic zones Disaster Management in India Figure 1.16: Tsunami travel times & response time travel time to the nearest coast in Nicobar would be approximately 20 \u2013 30 minutes and for the Indian mainland about 2 \u2013 3 hours. For earthquakes occurring near Indonesia, the travel time to Andaman & Nicobar would be in the range of 1 \u2013 2 hours and to the Indian mainland about 3 \u2013 5 hours. For earthquakes occurring off Makran, the travel time to the nearest Indian coast (Gujarat) would be about 2 \u2013 3 hours.

It is accompanied with sudden release of harmful radiations or radioactive materials or both together in to the environment. (i) Nuclear emergency may be encountered in the following situations: Intentional use of nuclear weapons in the event of war: Nuclear attacks may make use of nuclear weapons, which are extremely destructive and powerful enough to destroy an entire city.

While air accidents can occur at any time and at any place, areas within about 30 \u2013 40 kms. radius of airports are most vulnerable. Experience shows that a majority of air accidents occur either during take-off or landing near major airports where flight paths get congested. In addition, air accidents also take place at remote inaccessible places like forests, hilly and mountainous regions, high seas, etc. Accidents to Indian Civil Registered Aircraft from 1990 to 2000 may", "be seen in Table 1.23. 1.24.2 Causes: Causes of air accidents are either human failure of pilots, air traffic controllers or technical failures of on board, landing instruments.

While many infectious diseases like tuberculosis and malaria are endemic, some of them occasionally attain epidemic proportion. An epidemic refers to an increase, often sudden, in number of cases of a disease in a community clearly in excess of what is normally expected in that population. Epidemics are public health emergencies which disrupt routine health services and are major drain on resources. Epidemics include viral infections disease (mengitis, measles, dengue, polio, typhoid fever etc.) and", "Bacterial infectious diseases (cholera, diarrheoa etc.) The main causes for epidemic are non availability of clean and hygienic drinking water contamination of drinking water sources, lack of awareness about sanitation, unhygienic food, overcrowding, biological conditions in addition to ecological factors. Besides direct costs in epidemic control measures and treatment of patients, the indirect costs due to negative impact on domestic and international tourism and trade can be significant. For example, plague which was not reported from any part of India for almost a quarter of century, caused a major outbreak in Beed district in Maharashtra and Surat in Gujarat in 1994 and resulted in an estimated loss of almost US$ 1.7 billion. 1.26.2 Several factors related to microbes, environment and", "host susceptibility contribute to the occurrence of epidemics. Because of prevalence of these factors, developing countries including India are frequently affected by epidemics/ outbreaks which result in high morbidity and mortality and affect the public health and economy adversely. Outbreaks reported by States under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) during the period 2008-2010 are shown in Table 1.27. Disaster Management in India Table 1.27: Disease-wise outbreaks/epidemics reported by states under IDSP, 2008-10 No. of outbreaks Acute Diarrhoeal Disease Acute Encephalitis Syndrome Acute Respiratory Illness Source: National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) 1.26.3 As shown in the Table 1.27, most of the outbreaks/epidemics reported in India are due to water-borne diseases, vector-borne diseases and vaccine preventable diseases. While National Vector", "Borne Diseases Control Programme (NVBDCP) is the key programme for prevention/ control of outbreak of epidemics of malaria, dengue, chikungunya etc, vaccines administered under UIP/EPI reduce the morbidity and mortality due to diseases like measles, diphtheria, pertussis, poliomyelitis etc. Availability of safe water and adoption of personal and domestic hygienic practices are important measures to prevent/control epidemics of water-borne diseases like cholera, viral hepatitis etc. 1.27 Deaths due to Unnatural Cause25 1.27.1 A comparative list prepared by National Crime Record Bureau, MHA for year 2008 and 2009 in respect of death due to unnatural cause have been given in Table 1.28, which would show the enormity of problems leading to such deaths which attracts little attention due to their sporadic", "nature and such calamity happening in a diffused manner and not in one event generally.

Injuries resulting from the accidents handicap many people. These unfortunate victims are important members of their families as well as of the society. This way, the loss due to accidents and suicides is felt by family members and society at large. The deep and wide impact of accidents and suicides make it incumbent upon society to make efforts at reducing the incidence of these phenomena. Appropriate intervention measures can be", "devised only after studying various facets of these phenomena. Detailed data is a sine qua non for any study. While individual disaster and event data maintained by the states and reported to the GOI may not accurately tally with the NCRB report as some are maintained calendar year wise and some financial year wise yet the NCRB collected data is a useful data for analysis. This data on accidental deaths due to causes attributable to nature - such as cyclone / tornado, earthquake, flood, landslide and torrential rains, to name a few - as well as those not attributable to nature - for example, explosion, fire, sudden deaths, stampede, traffic accidents and others are revealing. These may be seen from", "the Figure 1.21. Accidental deaths due to natural causes were 6.2 % and those due to unnatural causes were 93.8% and traffic accidents account for the maximum deaths. These trends are a cause of concern for every class of the society, especially to policy makers principally for two reasons. Firstly, the Government is committed for improving the living conditions of its citizens and Secondly, the loss of these lives results in irreparable damage to the society. A series of catastrophes across the world in recent times have served as a reminder and backdrop of the chapters following the overview which is an attempt to capture valuable and available information across sectors and departments with focus on disaster management. It is", "hoped that the information will serve as a tool to improve the roles and capacities of all the stakeholders while facing the hazards, risks and the resultant disasters. Figure 1.21: Unnatural deaths in 2009- Causes, Number and as a percentage of the Total deaths Source: National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) Disaster Management in India 2.1 Evolution of Disaster Management in India Disaster management in India has evolved from an activity-based reactive setup to a proactive institutionalized structure; from single faculty domain to a multi-stakeholder setup; and from a relief-based approach to a \u2018multi-dimensional pro-active holistic approach for reducing risk\u2019. The beginnings of an institutional structure for disaster management can be traced to the British period following the series of disasters", "such as famines of 1900, 1905, 1907 & 1943, and the Bihar-Nepal earthquake of 1937. Over the past century, the disaster management in India has undergone substantive changes in its composition, nature and policy. 2.2 Disaster Management during British Administration and Post Independence During the British administration, relief departments were set up for emergencies during disasters. Such an activity-based setup with a reactive approach was functional only in the post- disaster scenarios. The policy was relief-oriented and activities included designing the relief codes and initialising food for work programmes. Post-Independence, the task for managing disasters continued to rest with the Relief Commissioners in each state, who functioned under the Central Relief Commissioner, with their role limited to delegation of relief", "material and money in the affected areas. Every five-year plan addressed flood disasters under \u201cIrrigation, Command Area Development and Flood Control\u201d. Until this stage, the disaster management structure was activity-based, functioning under the Relief Departments. 2.3 Emergence of Institutional Arrangement in India A permanent and institutionalised setup began in the decade of 1990s with set up of a disaster management cell under the Ministry of Agriculture, following the declaration of the decade of 1990 as the \u2018International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction\u2019 (IDNDR) by the UN General Assembly. Following series of disasters such as Latur Earthquake (1993), Malpa Landslide (1994), Orissa Super Cyclone (1999) and Bhuj Earthquake (2001), a high powered Committee under the Chairmanship of Mr. J.C. Pant, Secretary,", "Ministry of Agriculture was constituted for drawing up a systematic, comprehensive and holistic approach towards disasters. There was a shift in policy from an approach of relief through financial aid to a holistic one for addressing disaster management. Consequently, the disaster management division was shifted under the Ministry of Home Affairs in 2002 vide Cabinet Secretariat\u2019s Notification No. DOC.CD-108/2002 dated 27/02/2002 and a hierarchical structure for disaster management evolved in India. 2.4 Organisation and Structure of Disaster Management The Disaster Management Division is headed by Joint Secretary (DM) in MHA, who is assisted by three Directors, Under Secretaries, Section Officers, Technical Officer, Senior Economic Investigator consultants and other supporting staff. The upper echelon of the structure consists of Secretary (Border", "Management), Home Secretary, Minister of State in charge and the Home Minister. 2.5 Disaster Management Framework Shifting from relief and response mode, disaster management in India started to address the issues of early warning systems, forecasting and monitoring setup for various weather related hazards. A structure for flow of information, in the form of warnings, alerts and updates about the oncoming hazard, also emerged within this framework. A multi-stakeholder High powered group was setup by involving representatives from different ministries and departments. Some of these ministries were also designated as the nodal authorities for specific disasters. Disaster Management in India Following a High Powered Committee Report on Disaster Management for establishment of a separate institutional structure for addressing disasters and", "enactment of a suitable law for institutionalizing disaster management in the country, a multi-level links between these ministries and the disaster management framework have emerged. Disaster Management framework may be seen in Figure 2.8. 2.6 Present Structure for Disaster Management in India 2.6.1 The institutional structure for disaster management in India is in a state of transition. The new setup, following the implementation of the Act, is evolving; while the previous structure also continues (Figure 2.1). Thus, the two structures co-exist at present. The National Disaster Management Authority has been established at the centre, and the SDMA at state and district authorities at district level are gradually being formalized. In addition to this, the National Crisis Management Committee, part of", "the earlier setup, also functions at the Centre. The nodal ministries, as identified for different disaster types of function under the overall guidance of the Ministry of Home Affairs (nodal ministry for disaster management). This makes the stakeholders interact at different levels within the disaster management framework. 2.6.2 Within this transitional and evolving setup, two distinct features of the institutional structure for disaster management may be noticed. Firstly, the structure is hierarchical and functions at four levels \u2013 centre, state, district and local. In both the setups \u2013 one that existed prior to the implementation of the Act, and other that is being formalized post-implementation of the Act, there have existed institutionalized structures at the centre, state, district and local", "levels. Each preceding level guides the activities and decision making at the next level in hierarchy. Secondly, it is a multi-stakeholder setup, i.e., the structure draws involvement of various relevant ministries, government departments and administrative bodies. Cabinet Committee on Natural Ministry of Home Affairs High Level Committee Central Para Military Forces National Institute for Disaster Management Ministries and Departments of Government of India Planning Commission Ministries and Departments of States State Disaster Response Force Academic Institutions Scientific Organizations Technical Institutions Corporate Sectors Professional Bodies National Disaster Mitigation Resource (central) National Disaster Response Force Local Authorities District Administration Interministerial Committee GOVERNMENT OF INDIA Figure 2.1: National Disaster Management Structure Institutional Framework 2.7 Disaster Management Act, 2005 2.7.1 This Act provides for", "the effective management of disaster and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. It provides institutional mechanisms for drawing up and monitoring the implementation of the disaster management. The Act also ensures measures by the various wings of the Government for prevention and mitigation of disasters and prompt response to any disaster situation. 2.7.2 The Act provides for setting up of a National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister, State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) under the Chairmanship of the Chief Ministers, District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs) under the Chairmanship of Collectors/District Magistrates/Deputy Commissioners. The Act further provides for the constitution of different Executive Committee at national and state levels. Under its aegis, the National Institute", "of Disaster Management (NIDM) for capacity building and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) for response purpose have been set up. It also mandates the concerned Ministries and Departments to draw up their own plans in accordance with the National Plan. The Act further contains the provisions for financial mechanisms such as creation of funds for response, National Disaster Mitigation Fund and similar funds at the state and district levels for the purpose of disaster management. The Act also provides specific roles to local bodies in disaster management. 2.7.3 Further the enactment of 73rd and 74th Amendments to the constitution and emergence of local self- government, both rural and urban, as important tiers of governance, the role of local authorities becomes", "very important. The DM Act, 2005 also envisages specific roles to be played by the local bodies in disaster management. 2.7.4 Legal - Institutional Framework: A legal institutional framework developed based on the provision of the Act across the country, in vertical and horizontal hierarchical and in the federal setup of country may be seen in the Figure 2.2 for appreciation of response mechanism which has been put in place. National Level Institutions 2.8. National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) was initially constituted on May 30, 2005 under the Chairmanship of Prime Minister vide an executive order. Following enactment of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the NDMA was formally constituted in accordance with Section-3(1) of", "the Act on 27th September, 2006 with Prime Minister as its Chairperson and nine other members, and one such member to be designated as Vice-Chairperson. 2.8.1 Mandate of NDMA: The NDMA has been mandated with laying down policies on disaster management and guidelines which would be followed by different Ministries, Departments of the Government of India and State Government in taking measures for disaster risk reduction. It has also to laid down guidelines to be followed by the State Authorities in drawing up the State Plans and to take such measures for the management of disasters, Details of these responsibilities are given as under :- (a) Lay down policies on disaster management; Disaster Management in India (b) Approve the National", "Plan; (c) Approve plans prepared by the Ministries or Departments of the Government of India in accordance with the National Plan; (d) Lay down guidelines to be followed by the State Authorities in drawing up the State (e) Lay down guidelines to be followed by the different Ministries or Departments of the Government of India for the purpose of integrating the measures for prevention of disaster or the mitigation of its effects in their development plans and projects; (f) Coordinate the enforcement and implementation of the policy and plan for disaster (g) Recommend provision of funds for the purpose of mitigation; (h) Provide such support to other countries affected by major disasters as may be determined by the Central Government;", "(i) Take such other measures for the prevention of disaster, or the mitigation, or preparedness and capacity building for dealing with the threatening disaster situation or disaster as it may consider necessary; (j) Lay down broad policies and guidelines for the functioning of the National Institute of Disaster Management. 2.8.2 Composition of NDMA: Besides the nine members nominated by the Prime Minister, Chairperson of the Authority, the Organisational structure consists of a Secretary and five Joint Secretaries including one Financial Advisor.

The District Authority also has the power to examine the construction in any area in the district to enforce the safety standards and also to arrange for relief measures and respond to the disaster at the district level. 2.13. Institutional Framework for Metropolitan Cities In the larger cities (say, with population exceeding 2.5 million), the recommendation of the second Administrative Reforms Commission has suggested that the Mayor, assisted by the Commissioner of the Municipal Corporation and the Police Commissioner to be directly responsible for Crisis Management. It has now been accepted by the Government. 2.14 Hierarchical Structure of Authority and Committee In", "this structure, National Disaster Management Authority is the authority for formulation of policy and guidelines for all disaster management work in the country. The state authorities further lay down the guidelines for departments of the state and the districts falling in their respective jurisdictions. Similarly, district authorities direct the civil administration, departments and local authorities such as the municipalities, police department and civil administration. The State Executive Committees are responsible for execution of the tasks envisaged by the authorities. The structure thus discussed is summarised in the Figure 2.3.

The details of such training programmes are given in Chapter 7 of Capacity 2.17 State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) The states/UTs have also been advised to set up their own Specialist Response Force for responding to disasters on the lines of National Disaster Response Force vide Ministry of Home Affairs letter dated 26th July", "2007 and 8th March, 2011. The Central Government is providing assistance for training of trainers. The state governments have been also advised to utilise 10 percent of their State Disaster Response Fund and Capacity Building Grant for the procurement of search and rescue equipment and for training purposes of the Response Force. 2.18 Civil Defence 2.18.1 Aims and Objectives of Civil Defence Act: The Civil Defence Policy of the GoI until 1962 was confined to making the states and UTs conscious of the need of civil protection measures and to keep in readiness civil protection plans for major cities and towns under the Emergency Relief Organisation (ERO) scheme. The legislation on Civil Defence (CD) known as Civil Defence Act was", "enacted in 1968 which is in force throughout the country. 2.18.2 The Act defines CD and provides for the powers of Central Government to make rules for CD, spelling out various actions to be taken for CD measures. It further stipulates for constitution of CD corps, appointment of members and officers, functions of members etc. The Act has since been amended in 2010 to cater to the needs of disaster management Institutional Framework so as to utilise the services of Civil Defence volunteers effectively for enhancement of public participation in disaster management related activities in the country. 2.18.3 The CD Organisation is raised only in such areas and zones which are considered vulnerable to enemy attacks. The revision and renewal", "of categorised CD towns is done at regular intervals, with the level of perceived threat or external aggression or hostile attacks by anti- national elements or terrorists to vital installations. 2.18.4 Compendium of instructions \u2013 CD deals very briefly with all different aspects of CD in India and includes references to important policy letters including legal aspects. It was first published in February 1969. Subsequently, its scope was enlarged by including the Master Plan of Civil Defence, Civil Defence Act 1968, training courses conducted at NCDC, Nagpur, training syllabus of states. 2.18.5 Role of Civil Defence: During times of war and emergencies, the CD organisation has the vital role of guarding the hinterland, supporting the armed forces, mobilising the citizens", "and helping civil administration for saving life and property, minimising damage, maintaining continuity in production centers and raising public morale. The concept of CD over the years has shifted from management of damage against conventional weapons to also include threat perceptions against nuclear weapons, biological and chemical warfare and environmental 2.18.6 Three tier structure as given below has been created to formulate CD policy and for coordinating and supervising measures to implement it. \u2022 Civil Defence Advisory Committee under the Chairmanship of Union Home Minister, \u2022 Civil Defence Committee under the Chairmanship of Home Secretary and \u2022 Civil Defence Joint Planning Staff Committee under the Chairmanship of Director General 2.18.7 Eligibility to become volunteers: (a) A person who intends to", "apply for appointment to a Civil Defence Corps must fulfill the following conditions:- \u2022 to be a citizen of India or Bhutan or of Nepal; \u2022 to have completed the age of 18 years provided that this age limit may be relaxed at the discretion of the competent authority up to a maximum of three years for any branch or category of the Corps, \u2022 to have passed at least the primary standard, that is to say, the fourth class; and this condition may be relaxed by the Controller at his discretion.

An IPS officer in the rank of Director General of Police heads the organisation. He has dual charge of D.G. National Disaster Response Force and Civil Defence (DG, NDRF & CD). 2.18.9 Civil Defence Setup in the States: The state government for the purpose of coordinating the activities of the Controllers of Civil Defence within the state appoints a Director of Civil Defence and also may constitute,", "for any area within the state a body of a person to be called the Civil Defence Corps. Out of 225 towns from 35 states notified as CD towns, currently the CD organisations at only 130 towns have been activated. Each town has nucleus of four Permanent Staff along with 400 CD Volunteers for a two lakh population. It is expected that each state will have one CD Training Institute with permanent strength of 36 personnel, five vehicles and other equipments. The District Magistrate is designated as a Controller for CD Towns. The present strength of CD volunteers is 5.72 lakhs, out of which 5.11 lakhs are already trained. The target strength of CD volunteers has been fixed at 13", "lakhs based on the population of CD towns as per 2001 census. In accordance with the directions issued by Hon\u2019ble Home Minister, one member high powered committee was constituted on 7th February, 2006 under the chairmanship of one of the member of NDMA to analyse the existing functions of Civil Defence Organisations and suggest changes required to enlarge its role to include Disaster Management. 2.18.10 Civil Defence at district level: The state government may appoint a person, not being in its opinion, below the rank of a District Magistrate to be known as the \u201cController\u201d. Under certain conditions, the state government may also appoint a Deputy Controller of Civil Defence in appropriate rank up to that of Deputy Collector, but", "not inferior to that of a Sub- Divisional Magistrate. 2.19 Fire Services 2.19.1 Fire services are mandate of the Municipal Bodies as estimated in item 7 of Schedule 12 under Article 243W of the constitution. The structure across is not uniform. Presently Fire prevention and Fire Fighting Services are organized by the concerned States and UTs. Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India, renders technical advice to the States and UTs and Central Ministries on Fire Protection, Fire Prevention and Fire Legislation. 2.19.2 The Government of India in 1956, formed a \u201cStanding Fire Advisory Committee\u201d under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The mandate of the committee was to examine the technical problems Institutional Framework relating to Fire Services and to", "advise the Government of India for speedy development and upgradation of Fire Services all over the country. This committee had representation from each State Fire Services, as well as the representation from Ministry of Home, Defence, Transport, Communication and Bureau of Indian Standards. This Committee was renamed as \u201cStanding Fire Advisory Council\u201d (SFAC) during the year 1980. 2.19.3 Fire Services in Gujarat, Chhatisgarh, Punjab, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh excluding Indore are under the respective concerned Municipal Corporations. In other remaining States it is under the Home Department. While some States have enacted their own Fire Act, some others have not. As on today, there is no standardization with regard to the scaling of equipment, the type of", "equipment, or the training of their manpower. In each state it has grown according to the initiatives taken by the States and the funds provided for the Fire Services. 2.19.4 Presently the only Basic Life Line of Fire & Emergency Services which is fully committed to the common public, is the Municipal in some states and State Fire Services. The Airport Authority, Big Industrial Establishments, CISF and Armed Forces, however also have their own Fire Services and many a times in case of need rush in aid to the local Fire Services. Apart from the lack of being a proper government department with a complete developmental plan, State Fire Services have their own organizational structure, administrative setup, funding mechanism, training", "facilities and equipments. 2.20 National Civil Defence College (NCDC), Nagpur The first Disaster Management Training Institution of the country was founded on 29th April 1957 at Nagpur as the Central Emergency Relief Training Institute (CERTI) to support the Emergency Relief Organisation of the Government of India. This Institute organised advanced and specialist training for revenue officials responsible for Disaster Relief Operations against any natural or manmade disaster. CERTI was renamed as National Civil Defence College on 1st April 1968. NCDC is mandated for conducting training courses for various groups of stakeholders. Details of training on capacity development are given in Chapter on Capacity Development 2.21 National Fire Service College (NFSC), Nagpur 2.21.1 The National Fire Service College was established in", "1956 as a sub- ordinate establishment of Ministry of Home Affairs with the aim of providing training to the Fire Officers of the country in advanced techniques of fire fighting and rescue, and creating uniformity in the Fire Service organisations and their management across the country. NFSC began its activities with only one course; later, considering the needs of the country, industrialisation and growth of Indian industry, had added many more courses to its curriculum to give the fire training a professional 2.21.2 The college has so far trained 15197 fire officers in the country. Being a residential college, National Fire Service College (NFSC), has its own hostel facilities with well furnished accommodation for about 200 trainees at a time.", "2.21.3 The college awards certificates, diplomas, and advanced diplomas on successful completion of courses. These are recognized by the state, central government, the public and Disaster Management in India private sectors and the business community as well. In addition, the diploma and advanced diploma of NFSC are also recognised by the Union Public Service Commission for appointment in the middle management cadre. 2.22.1 Role: The role of Home Guards is to serve as an auxiliary to the police in the maintenance of law and order, internal security and help the community in any kind of emergency such as air-raid, fire, cyclone, earthquake, epidemic etc. They are also expected to help the police in maintenance of communal harmony, assist the administration", "in protecting weaker sections, participate in socio-economic and welfare activities and perform Civil Defence duties. 2.22.2 Types: Home Guards are of two types \u2013 rural and urban besides in Border States, Border Wing Home Guards Battalions at national level. Border Wing, Home Guard serve as an auxiliary to the Border Security Force. The total strength of Home Guards is 5, 73,793 against which the raised strength is 5,00,410. The organisation is spread over all states and UTs except in Kerala. Eighteen Border Wing Home Guards (BWHG) Battalions have been raised in the border states viz. Punjab (6 Bns.), Rajasthan (4 Bns.), Gujarat (4Bns.) and one of Bn each. for Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and West Bengal to serve as an auxiliary", "to Border Security Force for preventing infiltration on the international border and coastal areas, guarding of vital Installations and lines of communication in vulnerable areas at the time of external aggression. 2.22.3 Statutory Mechanisms and Service Condition: Home Guards are raised under the Home Guards Act and Rules of the states and UTs. They are recruited from a cross section of the population such as doctors, engineers, lawyers, private sector organisations, college and university students, agricultural and industrial workers, etc. who give their spare time to the organisation for betterment of the community. Home Guards are provided free uniform, duty allowances and awards for gallantry, distinguished and meritorious services. Members of Home Guards with three year service in the organisation", "are trained to assist police in maintenance of law and order, prevention of crime, anti-decoity measures, border patrolling, prohibition, flood relief, fire-fighting, election duties and social welfare activities. The Ministry of Home Affairs formulates the policy regarding role, target, raising, training, equipping, establishment and other important matters of Home Guards Organisation. 2.23 Interface between the Ministries for disaster Management 2.23.1 The interface between stakeholders and the disaster management framework is permanent, backed by legislative measures, decisions, such as those taken for establishment of the bodies and committees for managing disasters and the government orders to execute these decisions. These decisions or measures direct the composition of the structure by identifying the stakeholders to be involved in the disaster management framework.", "The role to be performed by each stakeholder is in the evolving stage and needs to be defined within different SOPs. Thus, while the involvement of stakeholders in the interface is mandated and permanent, the nature of interface is guided by the expertise or relevance of the stakeholder to the disaster management framework. 2.23.2 The expertise based interfaces emerge when the stakeholders serve as \u2018service providers\u2019 to the disaster management framework. For instance, the institutions under Ministry of Earth Institutional Framework Sciences and Ministry of Water Resources, that is, Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and Central Water Commission (CWC) respectively, provide information on the weather and climatic parameters and the potential hazards and threats to the nodal management authority. Further, these", "organizations are involved with disaster planning activities \u2013 flood zonation and flood plain management in case of CWC, and hazard mapping and database generation in case of IMD. The organizations and institutions under the Department of Space provide research and technical support by monitoring the weather elements and facilitating satellite based communication, and also undertaking activities such as land use mapping and hazard zoning. 2.23.3 The framework which emerges from above discussion may be summarised in a flow chart form as given in Figure 2.8. Figure 2.8: Interface among the stakeholders, leading to the development of society 2.23.3 The Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) should be seen as on integral part of environment (climate change also) and development. The impending risk", "analysis should be done in the light of disasters and possible threat of high intensity disasters due to climate change. Accordingly, mitigation and adaptation programmes should be developed. The mitigation plan should address the issues of structural and non-structural interventions along with the fiscal and monetary tools (for DRR & adaptation) for pre and post disaster planning. If this is main streamed, sustainable development can be attained and miseries of the people could be minimised. The top down and bottom up institutional linkages for policy formulation and programme execution would be interdependent with each other.

Town planning, bye-laws, structural safety audits of existing lifeline structures and other critical structures in earthquake prone areas, carrying out selective seismic strengthening and retrofitting ought", "to be addressed. 3.4.4 Management of Floods: The guidelines aim at measures for preparedness, prevention, mitigation in the pre-flood stage and on prompt and effective response, relief and recovery during Disaster Management in India \u2013 and post flood stages. Importance on non-structural measures besides structural measures is emphasized in the guidelines. Setting of basin-wise organisations for flood management and also for setting up a National Flood Management Institute for training, education and research are suggested in the guideline. 3.4.5 Chemical Disasters (Industrial): These guidelines call for a protective, participatory, well-structured, fail-safe, multi-disciplinary and multi-structural approach at various levels. On the basis of vulnerabilities and consequences of chemical accidents, the guidelines review the existing regulatory framework and practices and thus propose", "for a regulatory framework, code of practices, capacity development, institutional framework, etc. They further set out an approach for implementation of the guidelines. 3.4.6 Management of Chemical (Terrorism) Disasters: The guidelines focus on outlining the preparedness and efforts made for mitigating the chemical terrorism, the act of violence perpetrated to achieve professed aims, using chemical agents. While reviewing the existing legislations and regulatory framework, the guidelines identify the gaps and propose the measures required to fill the gaps in the legislative and regulatory frameworks. They also deal with the aspects of surveillance measures for strengthening the intelligence in order to prevent intentional use of chemical agents. 3.4.7 Preparation of State Disaster Management Plans: The aim of the state DM plan", "is to ensure that the components of DM are addressed to facilitate planning, preparedness, operational, coordination and community participation. The guideline suggests outlays for preparation of the plan to include the state profile, vulnerability assessment and risk analysis, prevention measures, mainstreaming DM concerns into developmental plan and programme projects, preparedness measures, response and partnership with the other stakeholders besides providing for financial arrangement. 3.4.8 Psycho-Social Support and Mental Health Services in Disasters: Disasters leave a trail of agony and affect the survivors\u2019 mental health. The guidelines on this subject outlay the entire gamut of psycho-social support and mental health services with a view to build the nation resilient to respond effectively in all types of disasters.

The concerned Ministries related to DM activities, either have come out with their own policy, plans and regulatory mechanisms for management of disasters pertaining to their domain or are at different stages of its formulations. It is hoped that by going through the details of the available policy and the guidelines and other information at one place, the other ministries, states and the stakeholders may get necessary inputs and", "guidance to use them and come up with effective and implementable plans at their level.", "4.1 Introduction The Yokohama message emanating from the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction in May 1994 underlined the need for an emphatic shift in the strategy for disaster mitigation. It inter-alia stressed that disaster prevention, mitigation, preparedness and relief were four elements, which contribute to and gain from the implementation of the sustainable development policies. These elements along with environmental protection and sustainable development, are closely inter related. Nations, therefore should incorporate them in their development plans and ensure efficient follow up measures at the community, sub-regional, regional, national and international levels. Disaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness are better than disaster response in achieving the goals and objectives of vulnerability reduction. It would be evident from the table given", "in 4.1 that if we compare the disasters of similar magnitude in USA and Japan with that of India it is found that the loss of lives in USA and Japan are much less as compared to that of India. The factors influencing reduced loss is attributed to the better preparedness in USA and Japan. Table 4.1: Comparison among India, Japan & USA on death in Earthquake of similar magnitude Intensity of Quake Human Lives Lost Southern California Landers California Northridge, California Central California Source: UNDP (BCPR) 4.2 Mainstreaming of Disaster Risk Reduction in Developmental Strategy 4.2.1 Prevention and mitigation contribute to lasting improvement in safety and should be integrated in the disaster management. The Government of India has adopted", "mitigation and prevention as essential components of their development strategy. Accordingly, the Tenth Five Year Plan document has a detailed chapter on disaster management. The plan emphasises the fact that development cannot be sustainable without mitigation being built into the developmental process. Disaster Management in India 4.2.2 Mainstreaming DRR involves incorporating disaster risk reduction into development policy and practice. It means radically expanding and enhancing disaster risk reduction so that it becomes normal practice, fully institutionalised within an agency\u2019s relief and development agenda. Mainstreaming has three purposes: (a) To make certain that all the development programmes and projects that originate from or are funded by an agency, are designed with evident consideration for potential disaster risks and to resist hazard", "impact, (b) To make certain that all the development programmes and projects that originate from or are funded by an agency, do not inadvertently increase vulnerability to disaster in all sectors: social, physical, economic and environment, (c) To make certain that all the disaster relief and rehabilitation programmes and projects that originate from or are funded by an agency are designed to contribute to developmental aims and to reduce future disaster risk. 4.2.3 Mainstreaming DRR into the developmental plans is an important mandate of the Disaster Management Act 2005. Integration of disaster risk reduction measures into ongoing flagship programmes of Government of India is being used as an entry point for mainstreaming DRR in development plans. Steps for ensuring the", "incorporation of DRR into various ongoing programmes\\plans are as follows: (a) Identification of key programme/projects of Government of India, (b) Identification of entry points within the programme for integration of DRR (structural, non- structural and other mitigation measures) at various levels viz. national, state and district (c) Close coordination with concerned departments such as State Planning Commission and Finance Department for promoting DRR measures into development plans and policies, (d) Advocacy for allocation of dedicated budget for DRR within the departmental plans, (e) Preparation of guidelines for integration of disaster risk reduction measures into development plans of various departments at the district and sub-district levels. 4.2.4 Mainstreaming of National Plan and its Sub-Plan: Three committees constituted by Government of India", "are working for preparing the National Response Plan, National Human Resource and Capacity Development Plan and Mitigation Plans by respective ministries who have been designated as nodal agencies for the disaster relating to their activities. The draft National Response Plan and National Human Resource and Capacity Development Plan are ready. Certain rectifications and modifications are underway before it is presented to the National Executive Committee for its approval. 4.2.5 It is expected that National Response Plan will be put in place once it is adopted by Government of India. It will pave the way for institutionalising the response plan at three tiers as envisaged in the Disaster Management Act. 4.2.6 Similarly, the Capacity Development Plan, once approved and adopted will", "provide a roadmap for undertaking the capacity building for people engaged in different facets of disaster management and enhance the capacity at the individual, organizational as well as at the environmental levels. Prevention and Mitigation 4.2.7 Mitigation Plans have been submitted by the ministries of Defence, Mines (Geological survey of India), Department of Atomic Energy, Department of Agriculture & Cooperation, Railways and Water Resources, which are under examination and finalization. It is expected that once these mitigation plans are approved, the concerned ministry will undertake activities for taking the prevention and mitigation measures to address the hazard and risk involved in the activities of their sector. It would be the endeavor of the government to persuade the other ministries who", "have yet to bring their Mitigation Plans at the draft stage to take it further for approval and adoption. 4.3 National Disaster Mitigation Fund: 4.3.1 Section 47 of the Disaster Management Act 2005 provides for constitution of National Disaster Mitigation Fund. The provisions of the Act are as under: (a) The Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, constitute a fund to be called the National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) for projects exclusively for the purpose of mitigation and there shall be credited thereto such amount which the Central Government may, after due appropriation made by parliament by law in this behalf. (b) The National Disaster Mitigation Fund shall be applied by the National Disaster Management 4.3.2 The", "modalities of constitution of NDMF have been discussed by MHA with the MoF, Planning Commission and NDMA from time to time. A reference was made to 13th Finance Commission. The 13th Finance Commission has given its report and as per its recommendations: \u201cMitigation and reconstruction activities should be kept out of the schemes funded through Finance Commission grants and met out of overall development plan funds of the centre and the states.\u201d The issue is under consideration of Ministry of Home Affairs with other concerned Ministries. 4.4. Measures taken for Prevention and Mitigation of Hazards Risk of destruction and casualties associated with different disasters can substantially be reduced by introduction of prevention and mitigation measures. Mitigation is generally categorised into", "two main types of activities i.e. structural and non-structural. Structural mitigation refers to any physical construction to reduce or avoid possible impacts of hazards, which include engineering measures and construction of hazard-resistant protective structures and infrastructure. Non- structural mitigation refers to policies, awareness, knowledge development, public commitment, and methods and operating practices, including participatory mechanisms and the provision of information, which can reduce risk with related impacts. The Government of India has adopted several mitigation measures for reducing the risk of being affected by disasters. These measures are being implemented by the concerned ministries. Some of these initiatives are described below. 4.5.1 India has been divided into five seismic zones according to the maximum intensity of earthquakes expected. Of these,", "zone V is most active and comprises whole of Northeast India, the northern portion of Bihar, western Uttar Pradesh hills, Himachal Pradesh and Andaman & Nicobar Islands. 4.5.2 Pace of Urbanisation in India has been increasing. Many of the cities and townships including the national capital of New Delhi, are located in zones of high seismic risk. Typically, the majority of the constructions in these cities are not earthquake resistant. Regulatory mechanisms are Disaster Management in India weak, thus any earthquake striking in one of these cities would turn into a major disaster. Six major earthquakes have struck different parts of India over a span of last 15 years. The following measures have been initiated for prevention and mitigation of", "such disasters: 4.5.3 National Earthquake Risk Mitigation Project (NERMP): Understanding the importance of the management of such hazardous situations caused by the earthquake, the Government of India has taken a national initiative for launching a project of \u2018National Earthquake Risk Mitigation Project (NERMP). The proposed project aims at strengthening the structural and non- structural earthquake mitigation efforts and reducing the vulnerability in the high risk districts prone to earthquakes. Necessary risk mitigation measures are proposed to be put in place in the highly seismic zones. NDMA, tasked with this project has prepared a Detailed Project Report (DPR) which is under consultation with all the stakeholders. The proposed components of the project include techno-legal regime, institutional strengthening, capacity building and public", "4.5.4 National Building Code (NBC): The National Building Code of India (NBC), a comprehensive building code, is a national instrument providing guidelines for regulating the building construction activities across the country. The NBC was first published in 1970 at the instance of Planning Commission and was revised in 1983. Thereafter three major amendments, two in 1987 and the third in 1997 were issued. Considering a series of further developments in the field of building construction, including the lessons learnt in the aftermath of number of natural calamities like devastating earthquakes and super cyclones, a project for comprehensive revision of NBC was taken up under the aegis of National Building Code Committee. The revised NBC has now been brought out as", "National Building Code of India 2005 (NBC 2005). The salient features of the revised NBC include meeting the challenges posed by natural calamities and reflecting the state-of-the-art and contemporary applicable international practices. The code may be accessed at http://www.bis.org.in/sf/nbc.htm. Box 4.1: Building collapse in Lalita Park, Laxmi Nagar, Delhi There was an incidence of building collapse in Lalita Park, Laxmi Nagar, East Delhi on 15th November 2010. Several people lost their life and many injured in this incidence. Lt. Governor of National Capital Delhi appointed an inquiry commission by exercising of the power conferred by section 3 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 (60 of 1952) and read with the Notification No. F.2/4/66-UT dated 20th August, 1966, issued by", "Govt. of India, Ministry of Home Affairs. Single member, namely, Sh. Lokeshwar Prasad, retired Justice of Delhi High Court has been appointed. The terms of reference of the Commission is as under:- to determine the immediate and proximate causes for the collapse of the building, to determine the circumstances and sequences of events leading to the collapse of the building, to fix responsibility, both individual and institutional, for the collapse of this building and for the building already built that are unsafe structurally in East Delhi, to determine the administrative, procedural and statutory lapses of various departments and agencies to evaluate structural safety aspects of buildings already built or proposed to be built in East Delhi and to recommend remedial", "measures, to recommend measures that will combat corruption and make concerted public servant accountable for construction of unsafe building. It is expected the commission will come out with recommendations, which may be useful for framing policy and action to contain such mishaps in future. 4.5.5 Effective implementation of these codes has been a challenge. The Bureau of Indian Standards & National Design and Research Forum with the Institute of Engineers have organised series of brainstorming sessions and workshops to pave the way to inculcate the same into practice. As part of their continuous efforts, a workshop has been scheduled in the month of in May 2011 titled \u201cImplementation of Standards in Infrastructural Development\u201d. 4.5.6 Efforts by Building Materials & Technology", "Promotion Council (BMTPC): The BMTPC undertook projects for retrofitting of life-line structures for generating awareness among the people as well as various government agencies about the need and techniques of retrofitting. The Council has initiated retrofitting of MCD school buildings in Delhi. It has further initiated a study of 250 bedded hall of Bara Hindu Rao Hospital, New Delhi. It has earlier carried out seismic strengthening and retrofitting of the sub-district hospital in Kupwara in Jammu & Kashmir, 442 structures in Gujarat and primary school buildings at Thano, Block Raipur and Dehradun. The experience on these retrofitted buildings is aimed to help people at large and the policy makers in particular in working towards reducing the vulnerability of lakhs of", "existing public and private buildings, thereby protecting most number of people in case of future earthquakes. 4.5.7 Earthquake and Seismic Zones: The entire Indian landmass, susceptible to different levels of earthquake hazards, referred to as Zone II to V as per the Seismic Zoning Map of India contained in IS 1893:2002 Fifth Revision. Jammu & Kashmir Earthquake 2005- Retrofitting on walls and windows Disaster Management in India The general basis of the zones is as follows: Zone V: Covers the areas liable to seismic intensity 1X and above on MSK (1964) Intensity scale. This is the most severe seismic zone and is referred here as Very High Damage Risk Zone. Zone IV: Gives the area liable to MSK VIII. This", "zone is second in severity to zone V. This referred here as High Damage Risk Zone. Zone III: The associated intensity is MSK VII. This is termed here as moderate Damage Risk Zone. Zone II: The probable intensity is MKS VII. This zone is referred to as Low Damage Risk Zone. Note: In the revision of the Seismic Zone Map given earlier in the Vulnerability Atlas of India 1997, the seismic zone I has now been merged into Seismic Zone II and renamed as Zone II, Zone III has been extended to cover more areas in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Zones IV and V have remained unchanged. It may be mentioned here that the new intensity scale, called", "as MSK Intensity Scale 1964, is much more detailed and quantitative in nature as compared to the Modified Mercalli (MM) though almost similar in intensity. Hence MSK has been used in place of MM in the classification of the seismic zones given above 4.5.8 Initiative by Ministry of Panchayati Raj: It releases funds under Backward Regions Grant Fund (BRGF) for meeting critical infrastructural gaps and other developmental requirements. The ministry has financed several district plans under the BRGF for construction of panchayat buildings, anganwadi centres, school buildings, class rooms, roads, bridges, culverts etc. and restructuring of State Institutes for Rural Development (SIRD) buildings, block resource centres, panchayat training centers etc. The ministry, vide its letter No. N-11012/35/2007- P&J, dated 2nd", "February 2010 has advised all the states that it is imperative for all such structures to be made disaster resilient in the line with the national vision of disaster management. Multi-purpose Cyclone Shelter, Kendrapada, Orissa Prevention and Mitigation 4.6.1 National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (NCRMP) Initiative: Recurrent cyclones account for a large number of deaths, loss of livelihood opportunities, loss of public and private property, and severe damage to infrastructure, thus reversing the developmental gains whenever disasters occur.

It aims at ensuring that arrangements are in place to mobilise the resources and capability for relief, rehabilitation, reconstruction and recovery from disasters besides creating awareness among vulnerable communities. NDMA has", "been entrusted to prepare a Detailed Project Report (DPR) on Flood Risk Mitigation Project. 4.7.2 Flood Management Programme: The state governments are engaged in flood management work since the independence of the country. Upto the Tenth Five Year Plan, 45.6 million hectares (m-ha.) of flood prone areas in the country had been provided a reasonable degree of protection. The Eleventh Five Year Plan envisages protecting an additional area of 2.18 million hectares. Management of water resources is primarily the responsibility of the state governments. The schemes for Flood Control and Protection are therefore, to be planned, funded and executed by the state governments.

The country has built many tsunami walls of up to 4.5 meters (15ft) to protect the populated coastal areas. Other localities have", "built floodgates and channels to redirect the water from incoming tsunami. However, their effectiveness has been questioned, as tsunami often overtops the barriers. For instance, the Okushiri Hokkaido tsunami which struck Okushiri Island of Hokkaido within two to five minutes of the earthquake on July 12, 1993 created waves as high as 30 meters (100ft) tall - as high as a 10-storey building. The port town on Aonae was completely protected by tsunami wall, but the waves washed right over the wall and destroyed all the wood-framed structures in the area. The wall may have succeeded in slowing down and moderating the height of tsunami, but it did not prevent major destruction and loss of lives.

DGCD is to conduct awareness programmes in the states. 4.12.3 Fire Hazard and Risk Analysis of fire services in the Country: The MHA has proposed to undertake a study on fire hazard and risk analysis of fire services in the country. The aim of the study is to identify gaps in existing fire services and evolve strategies for mitigating impacts of fire hazards in the country. The outcome of the study will be used to formulate an action plan (state/UT wise) for augmentation and future development of the fire services along with the plan to source the funding for its implementation.", "As a part of study, the consultant would be required to organise visits to each of the fire stations and fire service organisations in the country and generate database through primary and secondary surveys. Govt. of India has prepared the list of Multi-Hazard districts. List of Multi-Hazard districts is shown in Table 4.4. Prevention and Mitigation North East Delhi Himachal Pradesh Baleshwar (Balasore) Table 4.4: List of Multi-Hazard Districts For Creation of Civil Defence Set-up Disaster Management in India 4.13 Forest Fire Management: 4.13.1 Fire prevention, detection and suppression activities are state subjects. The Central Government has been formulating policy, planning and financing the states from time to time. Forest Protection Division of Ministry of Forests headed by DIG of", "Forests is responsible for the forest fire management at the central level. The Joint Forest Management Committees, 36,165 in number across the country, have been given the responsibility to protect the forests from fires. The Central Government has issued the National Forest Fire, Prevention and Control guidelines and has also worked on a National Master Plan on Forest Fire Control. 4.13.2 A centrally sponsored scheme \u2018Intensification of Forest Management\u2019 initiated since the Tenth Five Year Plan has allocated 15 percent of the funds for forest fire management. 4.14 Oil Industry In the oil industry, the disaster management plan is maintained at the area level and covers a wide aspect (since their activities are likely to affect local people also). Oil", "companies have established their Crisis Management Plan at the company level and at the HQ level also with specialist to deal with fires and other identified hazards. In oil companies, it has been observed that international players for rescue and recovery operations are also hired at very short notice at cater to the specific requirements. 4.15 Chemical Disasters The MOEF has taken the following measures towards developing a Regulatory Framework for Chemical Safety: (i) The Environment (Protection) Act was enacted in 1986. Under the Act, two rules have been notified for ensuring chemical safety, namely, (a) The Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rules, 1989 (MSIHC) amended in 1994 and 2000; (b) The Chemical Accidents (Emergency, Planning, Preparedness, and", "Response) Rules, 1996 (EPPR) under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. (ii) The Public Liability Insurance Act 1991, amended in 1992 and the Public Liability Insurance Rules 1991, amended in 1993 require maximum hazard units to procure an insurance policy and deposit an equal amount in the Environment Relief Fund to provide immediate relief to victims of chemical accidents. 4.16 Prevention of Disasters in Mines The various safeguards and preventive measures against coal mine fires are outlined in the Coal Mines Regulations, 1957 and related circulars, notifications and technical instructions. The Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS) examines from each and every application for underground and surface mining from all considerations. Wherever necessary the DGMS imposes additional precautionary and preventive measures.", "The officers of the DGMS from time to time inspect the mines to assess the implementation of the measures and suggest modifications, etc. For the new projects and reorganisational projects, after the issuance of the EIA Notification, 1994 under the Environment (protection) Act, 1986, it has become compulsory to get Prevention and Mitigation environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) and for this the mines are required to develop their Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) in which the problems of the mine fires are adequately addressed as the mine fires have considerable environmental impacts. 4.17.1 The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare is instrumental and responsible for implementation of various programmes on a national scale in the areas", "of prevention and control of major communicable diseases and promotion of traditional and indigenous systems of medicines. This ministry also assists states in preventing and controlling the spread of seasonal disease outbreaks and epidemics through technical assistance. It is actively involved in disease diagnosis during epidemics and outbreaks, operational research, manpower development, advisory role and other multifarious activities towards prevention and control of a cascade of epidemic prone disease of larger public health importance in collaboration with National Institute of Communicable Disease (NICD) and external organisations and institutes. (Photo : A health camp at Akkarapettai Villager in Nagapattinam District-December 2004) 4.17.2 Post-disaster management of health, sanitation and hygiene services is crucial to prevent an outbreak of epidemics. The draft Public", "Health (Prevention, Control and Management of Epidemics, Bio-terrorism and Disasters) Bill prepared by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare is under consideration for enactment. 4.17.3 National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme (NVBDCP) is the key programme for prevention/control of outbreaks/epidemics of malaria, dengue, chikungunya etc., vaccines administered to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to diseases like measles, diphtheria, pertussis, poliomyelitis etc. Two key measures to prevent/control epidemics of water-borne diseases like cholera, viral hepatitis etc. include making available safe water and ensuring personal and domestic hygienic practices are adopted. 4.17.4 It is impossible to always prevent epidemics, but its impact can always be mitigated by anticipating them and by being prepared. Epidemic preparedness and response is a multi-", "sectoral and multi-agency activity. Health sector plays a lead role in preparing and executing the epidemic preparedness plan but need the expertise and support of other disciplines/sectors also. Planning process will inter alia require extensive review of health infrastructure, disease surveillance and response system, availability of laboratories, trained professionals, drugs, vaccines and equipment in the country, communication system, coordinating mechanism between different sectors and between the national and international agencies and legal issues. 4.17.5 Accordingly, Govt. of India launched Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) in November 2004 to strengthen capacity at state/district levels to detect and respond to the epidemics in early rising phase. Under the project, the district and states have been strengthened by providing additional technical manpower (epidemiologists,", "microbiologists, entomologists), training of rapid response teams for outbreak investigation and control, strengthening of laboratories for detection of organisms causing epidemic prone diseases, and establishment of IT network for data compilation, dissemination and analysis. The states are at varying stages of 4.17.6 The key achievement of IDSP has been creation of capacity at sub-district/district/state levels to detect early warning signals and outbreaks of epidemic prone diseases so that they can Disaster Management in India Medical camp during Tsunami, 2004 in Nagapattinam, Tamil Nadu be responded early. They collect weekly surveillance data, monitor disease trends and investigate rising in cases. About 85% of districts are reporting these data to Central Surveillance Unit through e-mail and more than 60% report through portal.", "The result is that states have detected and responded to more number of outbreaks after implementation of IDSP. For example, a total of 553 outbreaks were reported and responded to by states in 2008, 799 outbreaks in 2009 and 990 outbreaks in 2010. Earlier not many outbreaks were reported in the country by the States/ 4.17.7 Finally, a mention must be made about the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 which were adopted by the 58th World Health Assembly in May 2005 and came into force on 15 June 2007 (in India on 8 August 2007). IHR (2005) also provide us an opportunity to strengthen core capacities to detect, assess and notify and control all public health emergencies of international concern", "(PHEIC). These capacities will also help us to control endemic infectious diseases which may not spread to other countries. 4.18 Measures taken for Rail Safety Several measures have been taken to improve safety of Rail Transportation which is summarised 4.18.1 Special Railway Safety Fund (SRSF): Arising out of an important recommendation of Railway Safety Review Committee (RSRC) (Khanna Committee), to pull up the backlog of arrears for track renewals, bridges, rolling stock and signaling gear within a fixed time frame, a non- lapsable \u2018Special Railway Safety Fund\u2019 of ` 17000 crores was set up with effect from 01.10.2001 with a contribution from the Ministry of Finance and Railways. Works related to replacement / renewal of over-aged bridges, signaling gears and", "replacement of narrow gauge locomotives is Prevention and Mitigation 4.18.2 Corporate Safety Plan (2003-2013): Railway Safety Review Committee (1998), in its report recommended that railways formulate a safety plan with the following broad To achieve reduction in rate of accidents per million train kilometers from 0.44 (in 2002-03) to 0.17 by the year 2013, Implement measures to reduce chances of passenger fatality substantially in consequential train accidents by 2013, Focus on development of manpower through major improvements in working environment and training to reduce the accidents attributable to human failure by 40 percent by 2013, Achieve safety culture on all fronts including maintenance depots, worksites, stations, Progressively achieve an environment of \u201cfail-proof\u201d from the present \u201cfail-safe\u201d system of asset failures", "by upgrading the systems by 2013, and Prioritisation of safety related projects. It is estimated that index of accidents per million train kilometers would be reduced from 0.44 (in 2002-03) to 0.17 in 2012-13. Similarly, the performance indices targets have been laid down for track defects, coach defects/ failures, wagon detachments/ failure, poor brake power (goods), incidence of train parting (goods), motive power defects, signal defects/ failures, communication failures and OHE (Overhead Equipment) defects. 4.18.3 Measures taken to reduce Derailments: Several measures have been taken to reduce the derailment such as Replacement of over-aged tracks, bridges, gears and rolling stock, Gradual phasing out of derailment prone four wheeler tank wagons, Reduction in Thermit welded joints on rails, use of SPURT", "Cars for rail flaw detection, Track circulation for enhanced safety in train operations, Introduction of Self Propelled Accident Relief Medical Van (SPARMV) and Wheel Impact Load Detector (WILD). 4.18.4 Measures taken to reduce Collisions; Similarly several measures are under implementation for reducing the incidents of collision which may be summarised such as; Extensive training to train operations staff Improved maintenance and safety checks Improvement in design of rolling stocks Installation of Anti Collision Device (ACD). ACD has been installed on 1900 Route kms. of Northeast Frontier Railway Railway and 800 route kms. on Konkan Railway Corporation Limited and put under trial. Decision has been taken to extend ACD to Southern Railway, South Central Railway and South Western Railway on a", "trial basis. 4.18.5 Measures taken to reduce level crossing accidents: Railway track have been jig jagging across the country side have rendered vulnerability profile of the people living near tracks very high. Following measures are underway to reduce accidents arising out of crossing them. Disaster Management in India Social awareness programmes have been launched in rural areas through divisions, Construction of Road Over Bridges (ROBs)/Road Under Bridges (RUBs) at level crossing with Train Vehicle Units (TVUs) > 1 lakh, limited use subways to replace level crossings, Manning of unmanned level crossings, Interlocking and provision of phones at level crossing gates, Trial of Train Actuated Warning Device (TAWD). 4.18.6 Measures taken to reduce fire accidents: Following measures have been taken to", "reduce the fire accidents, Provision of fire retardant material in new coaches and retro-fitment in existing coaches, Emergency exits have been introduced in coaches to reduce fatalities, Provision of electrical fire sensing and extinguishing system in rolling stock and stationary Provision of electrical fire sensing and extra quashing system in rolling stock and stationary 4.19.1 The main thrust of accident prevention and control across the world has been on the four (ii) Enforcement (iii) Engineering (iv Environment and Emergency care of road accident victims. 4.19.2 The measures taken by Government of India to reduce the risk of road accidents are summarised as follows: Road Engineering: These are design/specification related aspects of roads and highways to enhance road safety. The National", "Highway Authority of India (NHAI) is ensuring usage of road safety furniture and has taken a number of steps to enhance safety of road users. The safety measures are inbuilt in the projects during design, construction, operations and Enforcement: The state governments and UTs are to take measures for enforcing the statutory provisions provided under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989. The enforcement measures under the said statute provides for inspection, licensing and verification of fitness of vehicles. iii. Education and Training: These primarily involve spreading road safety awareness and imparting training to drivers. The initiatives undertaken in the field of training are refresher training for heavy vehicle drivers and providing financial assistance to", "states/UTs for setting up model driving schools to turn out well trained drivers. iv. Faster relief and evacuation of road accident victims: In order to reduce the trauma and probability of death and disability associated with the road accidents, National Highway Accident Relief Service Scheme has been initiated which provides for supply of cranes and ambulances to states/UTs and NGOs for relief, rescue and Prevention and Mitigation evacuation of accident victims to the closest medical centre and for clearing the Another measure is medical care in which financial assistance upto `1.50 crores was provided to the state government hospitals located on national highways for upgradation and strengthening of emergency facilities vi. Road Safety Audit: The specific aim of the road", "safety audit is to minimise the risk and safety of accidents on the national highways and expressways. 4.20 Civil Aviation 4.20.1 The Directorate General Civil Aviation (DGCA) has the regulatory responsibility for aviation safety. Its mandate is to ensure the highest level of safety in the Indian Aviation System by employing International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards and recommended practices. Mindful of India\u2019s State Safety Programme (SSP), DGCA is to maintain an integrated set of regulations and activities aimed at enhancing aviation safety. 4.20.2 DGCA implements proactive and as far as possible predictive strategies, for encouraging all stakeholders and service providers to understand the benefits of a safety culture, which are based on an inclusive reporting culture. DGCA fosters and", "assists stakeholders in developing comprehensive Safety Management Systems (SMS) and develops preventive safety strategies for the aviation system in an environment of a \u201cjust culture\u201d. DGCA works with service providers in a cooperative and collaborative manner to help them develop and establish their safety management systems. 4.20.3 The responsibility for coordination and search and rescue (SAR) with other agencies is, however vested with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) under the Airports Authority of India Act, 1944, as amended by AAI (Amendment) Rules, 2003. 4.20.4 The SSP is based on comprehensive analysis of the States Aviation System, safety policies, risk management, safety assurances and permission. 4.20.5 An appropriate legislative framework in safety management has been implemented in India in accordance", "with ICAO Standard and Recommended Practices (SARPs). For carrying out ICAO functions, India has three layers of legislation - the Aircraft Act 1934 which is the primary legislation, the secondary Aircraft Rules, 1937 and the tertiary Aircraft (Carriage of Dangerous Goods) Rules, 2003. 4.20.6 The DGCA has released a series of Safety Management System-Civil Aviation Regulation (SMS-CARs) about operational regulations and implementation policies for the applicable service providers. Effective planning and focus on prevention and mitigation would greatly help in ensuring that the hazards do not transform itself into disasters and the coping capacities of the vulnerable population is greatly increased. This would again need systematic planning and coordination to ensure that the Disaster Risk Reduction is constantly promoted and", "mainstreamed in the regular programmes of each department. Recently planning commission has constituted a committee for inclusion of DRR measures in the 12th five year plan.", "5.1 Introduction 5.1.1 Facing disaster by way of mitigation, prevention, preparedness, response, evacuation, relief and rehabilitation has been part of the administrative ethos. India has a long history of rendering relief in an organized fashion in times of drought and famine. The states have antiquated relief code which deals with the general principles of administration of relief. It starts with the responsibility of the Government for combating distress, defining scope of object of such measures etc. India, with a vast agrarian economy in the past had focused on distress relief mainly related to agricultural activities. Preparedness included collection of statistical data on the rainfall, weather conditions, crop pattern activities relating to management of cattle etc. The relief work focused on", "departmental work and village work for generation of employment during drought. With the changing pattern of disaster and with the introduction of technology, material and new financial terms into disaster management, several modifications have been incorporated in the administrative measures for relief work 5.1.2 The scope of disaster has since changed and so the response thereto. With the constitution of successive Finance Commission under the provision of the Constitution, the measures for relief and the scope of disaster have enlarged. An attempt has been made in the succeeding paragraphs to capture the information relating to timely prediction/forecasting of different kind of disasters and development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for responding such 5.2 Institutional Arrangements 5.2.1 Forecasting about climate change", "is pre requisite for taking preparedness measure to respond to the disaster is the most important element of disaster management.

IMD was formally established in 1875 with a network of about 90 weather observatories for systematic observation and research. 5.3.2 India Meteorological Department\u2019s tradition of monitoring weather and climate spans more than 135 years giving it a sound and useful dataset to fall", "back upon for environmental assessment. Ozone monitoring network was started as a globally pioneering effort as early as in 1954 realizing that this trace gas plays a very important role in atmospheric chemical mechanisms. It also started radiation measurements about 50 year back and currently maintaining 45 stations in the country for providing exclusive countrywide dataset for assessment of solar energy 5.3.3 A network of 10 Global Atmosphere Watch Stations (GAW, formerly Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network or BAPMoN) consisting of Allahabad, Jodhpur, Kodaikanal, Minicoy, Mohanbari, Port Blair, Pune, Nagpur, Srinagar and Vishakhapatnam, is maintained by IMD as per WMO protocols and standards since 1974 to generate data and information on the exchange of trace materials between the atmosphere and", "the earth\u2019s surface, making atmospheric turbidity and air quality measurements to quantify trends and acid rain threats. 5.3.4 Atmospheric monitoring: There are 25 types of atmospheric monitoring networks that are operated and coordinated by the IMD. This includes meteorological, climatologically, environment, air pollution and other specialized observation of atmospheric trace constituents. It maintains 559 surface meteorological observatories, about 35 radio-stations and 64 pilot balloon stations for monitoring the upper atmosphere. Specialized observations are made for agro meteorological purposes at 219 stations and radiation parameters are monitored at 45 stations. There are about 70 observatories that monitor current weather conditions for aviation. The IMD collects meteorological data over oceans by an establishment of cooperation fleet of Voluntary Observing Ships (VOF) comprising", "merchant ships of Indian registry, some foreign merchant vessels and a few ships of the Indian Navy. These ships, while sailing on the high seas, function as floating observatories. Records of observations are passed on to the IMD for analysis 5.4. Forecast of Rainfall 5.4.1 India receives 80 per cent of its annual rainfall during the southwest monsoon season of June to September. Rainfall over the country during this season shows a wide range of spatial variation due to orographic influences and preferential occurrence of rain-bearing systems in certain regions. India has a very extensive rain gauge network and rainfall monitoring over the 5.4.2 The real-time monitoring and statistical analysis of district wise daily rainfall is one of the important", "functions of the IMD at New Delhi. Based on the real time daily rainfall data, weekly district wise, sub-division wise and state wise rainfall distribution summaries are prepared regularly by the Rainfall Monitoring Unit. Maps showing weekly and cumulative rainfall figures in 36 meteorological subdivisions of the country are prepared. This information is very important to many user agencies, particularly for agricultural planning. Preparedness and Response 5.5. Forecasting System - Background 5.5.1 India Meteorological Department (IMD) follows a two-stage forecasting strategy for long range forecasting of the south-west monsoon season rainfall over the country as a whole. The Long Period Average (LPA) of the south-west monsoon season rainfall over the country as a whole for the period 1951-2000 is 89cm.", "The first long range forecast for the south-west monsoon season (June-September) rainfall is issued in April and the forecast update is issued in June. From 2007 onwards, IMD has been using the following statistical models for preparing quantitative and probabilistic forecasts of the south-west monsoon rainfall (June \u2013 September) for the country as a whole: A 5- parameter statistical ensemble forecasting system requiring data up to March, for the first forecast in April. A 6- parameter statistical ensemble forecasting system requiring data up to May for the forecast update in June. Three of these 6-parameters are same as that used for April forecast. For preparing the first stage forecast for the 2011 South-west monsoon rainfall for the country as a", "whole presented here, the 5-parameter statistical ensemble forecasting system has been used. 5.5.2 Operational Statistical Forecast System: In the IMD\u2019s Ensemble Statistical Forecasting system for April forecast, the following 5 predictors are used. The model error of the April forecasting systems is \u00b15%. Table 5.1: Model error of the April forecasting systems North Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature December + January Equatorial South Indian Ocean Sea Surface Temperature February + March East Asia Mean Sea Level Pressure February + March NW Europe Land Surface Air Temperature Equatorial Pacific Warm Water Volume February + March The 5-parameter ensemble statistical forecasting system was also used to prepare probability forecasts for five pre-defined rainfall categories. These are deficient (less than 90% of LPA), below", "normal (90-96% of LPA), normal (96-104% of LPA), above normal (104-110% of LPA) and excess (above 110% of LPA). The forecasted probabilities in percentage based on this system for the above 5 categories are 6%, 30%, 53%, 10% and 1% respectively. 5.5.3 Experimental Forecasts: IMD has an experimental dynamical forecast system. The experimental ensemble dynamical forecast for the 2011 south-west monsoon rainfall was computed as the ensemble average of 10 member forecasts with forecasted sea surface temperatures (SST) as boundary SST forcing. In addition, IMD takes into account the experimental forecasts prepared by the national institutes like Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad, National Aerospace Laboratories, Bangalore, Centre for Mathematical Modelling", "and Computer Simulation, Bangalore, National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Noida and Center for Development of Advanced Computing, Pune. Disaster Management in India Operational/experimental forecasts prepared by international institutes like the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, USA, International Research Institute for Climate and Society, USA, Meteorological Office, UK, the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts, UK , the Experimental Climate Prediction Center, USA, and World Meteorological Organization\u2019s Lead Centre for Long Range Forecasting - Multi-Model Ensemble were also taken into account. The experimental forecasts from majority of the statistical and dynamical models suggest below normal to normal monsoon season rainfall over the country as a whole. 5.5.4 Sea Surface Temperature Conditions over the equatorial Pacific & Indian Oceans:", "The El Ni\u00f1o conditions that were originated since June, 2009 peaked in December 2009 and then started to weaken to reach ENSO-neutral conditions in May, 2010. This continued till mid June when weak La Nina conditions emerged. The La Ni\u00f1a conditions strengthened subsequently and become moderate to strong during mid-August 2010 to early February 2011. The La Nina conditions since have weakened to weak to moderate strength as of mid-March 2011. The latest forecasts from a majority of the dynamical and statistical models indicate strong probability for the present La Ni\u00f1a conditions to continue till June. Subsequently the La Nina conditions are expected to weaken further to reach ENSO- neutral conditions. However, it may be mentioned that the climate forecasts", "prepared at this time of the year has large uncertainty. It is important to note that in addition to ENSO events, other factors such as the Indian Ocean Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) have also significant influence on Indian monsoon. Recent forecasts from some coupled models suggest possibility of the development of a weak negative Indian Ocean Dipole event during the second half of the year, which may not have much impact on the As the extreme sea surface temperature conditions over Pacific and Indian Oceans particularly ENSO conditions over Pacific (El Nino or La Nina) are known to have strong influence on the Indian summer monsoon, IMD is carefully monitoring the sea surface conditions over Pacific and 5.5.5 Forecast for", "the 2011 South-west monsoon rainfall: IMD\u2019s long range forecast for the 2011 south-west monsoon season (June to September) is that the rainfall for the country as a whole is most likely to be Normal (96-104% of Long Period Average (LPA)). There is very low probability for season rainfall to be deficient (below 90% of LPA) or excess (above 110% of LPA). Quantitatively, monsoon season rainfall is likely to be 98% of the LPA with a model error of \u00b1 5%. The LPA of the season rainfall over the country as a whole for the period 1951-2000 is 89 cm. IMD will update the above forecast in June 2011 as a part of the second stage forecast. Along with the update", "forecast, separate forecasts for the monthly (July and August) rainfall over the country as a whole and seasonal (June-September) rainfall over the four geographical regions of India will also be issued. Forecast for the rainfall over the country as a whole during the second of the season (August + September) will be issued in July and that for September will be issued 5.6 Forecasting and Warning of Cyclones 5.6.1 IMD is the nodal agency in the country to monitor and predict the cyclonic disturbances and issue the warning and advisory bulletins. IMD, New Delhi also acts as a Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) for providing tropical cyclone advisories to the World Preparedness and Response Meteorological Organization (WMO)/ Economic and Social", "Cooperation for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) Panel members countries viz Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Pakistan and Oman. IMD, New Delhi also works as a Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre (TCAC) for international civil aviation as per the requirement of International Civil Aviation Organization 5.6.2 The cyclone warning are issued to State Government officials in four stages: i.e. (i) pre-cyclone watch issued 72 hours in advance, (ii) cyclone alert issued at least 48 hours in advance , (iii) cyclone warning issued at least 24 hours in advance, and (iv) as post landfall outlook issued at least 12 hours in advance of expected time of landfall. IMD has prepared roadmap for cyclonegenesis and further intensification, monitoring and 5.7. Flood Forecasting", "\u2013 Central Water Commission27 5.7.1 The flood forecasting and warning system is used for alerting the likely damage centre well in advance of the actual arrival of floods, to enable the people to move and also to remove the moveable property to safer places or to raised platforms specially constructed for the purpose. 5.7.2 A beginning in scientific flood forecasting was made in November, 1958 by CWC (then known as Central Water & Power Commission) when a Flood Forecasting Centre was set up at its Headquarters, at Delhi for giving timely Forecasts and Warnings of the incoming floods to the villages located in the river areas around the National Capital, Delhi. The network has been expanding and by now the", "Flood Forecasting Network of the CWC covers the entire major flood prone inter State basins in the country. 5.7.3 The flood forecasting involves the following four main activities: (i) observation and collection of hydrological and hydro meteorological data, (ii) transmission of Data to forecasting centres, (iii) analysis of data and formulation of forecast, and (iv) Dissemination of forecast. 5.7.4 On an average 6000 forecasts at various places in the country are issued during the monsoon seasons every year. The analysis of the forecasts issued during the last 25 years (1978 to 2002) indicates that accuracy of forecasts has consistently increased from around 81% to 98%. Forecast is considered accurate if forecast water level is within + 15 cm of actual", "water level of the inflow forecast (i.e. discharge) and is within + 20% of actual discharge. 5.7.5 In monitoring the floods, severity of floods are placed in the following four categories by (i) Low Flood stage \u2013 It is that flood situation when the water level of the river is flowing between warning level and danger level of the forecasting stations. (ii) Medium flood stage \u2013 The river is called in medium floods when its water level is at or above the danger level of the forecasting station but below 0.50 of its highest flood level (HFL) Disaster Management in India (iii) High flood state \u2013 When the water level of the river is below the HFL but within 0.50", "m of the HFL of the forecasting stations. (iv) Unprecedented flood stage \u2013 The river is called in unprecedented floods when it attains water level equal to or above its previous HFL at any forecasting stations. 5.7.6 A computerized monitoring system has been developed under which daily water levels as observed at 0800 hours and forecasts issued by field units are transmitted to CWC headquarters in New Delhi. Based on the compilation of all such data received from field divisions, daily water level and flood forecast bulletins in two parts for stage and for inflow forecasting stations 5.8 Tsunami warning \u2013 Indian National Centre for Oceanic Information System 5.8.1 Post tsunami dated 26th December, 2004, Ministry of Earth Sciences has", "established the Indian National Tsunami Warning System at Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Hyderabad. The Tsunami Early Warning System (TEWS) was made operational on 15th Oct 2007. This agency has developed a protocol for issue for Tsunami Watch, Alert and Warnings. The Centre gives information to all responders about the origin, time, location of the epicenter, magnitude and depth of an earthquake inside the ocean and accordingly issues 5.8.2 The system is capable of detecting all earthquake events of more than 6 Magnitude occurring in the Indian Ocean in less than 20 minutes of occurrence and first report on the occurrence of an earthquake in India and the Indian Ocean region to sent to MHA within 25-", "30 minutes indicating the location and magnitude of the earthquake. Further, if any rise in water level is reported by NIOT, TEWC would issue a Tsunami warning within 60 minutes of the occurrence of the earthquake. The information so generated would be disseminated through various communication channels to the concerned user agencies in a fully automated mode. 5.9 Warning about Landslide hazard \u2013 Geological Survey of India (GSI) 5.9.1 Geological Survey of India (GSI), established in 1851 is a government organization under the Union Ministry of Mines with the Headquarter at New Delhi for conducting geological surveys and studies. It is one of the oldest of such organizations in the world. 5.9.2 The GSI was designated as nodal agency for", "coordinating geological studies, landslides hazard zonation, monitoring landslides, avalanches, studying the factors responsible and suggesting precautionary and preventive measure on 29th January, 2004. The input from GSI as nodal agency help the Ministries and Departments concerned in the Central Government as well as the State Government for taking appropriate preventive and mitigation measures for reducing landslide hazard and responding in the mountainous areas and hill in the Himalayan and sub Himalayan regions. GSI is the nodal agency responsible for early warning relating to the landslides in the country. 5.9.3 Study of Land Contour by GSI: Geological Survey of India (GSI) studies the shape and material of the land getting inundated and generates data on area, shape, slope, infiltration and permeability", "of soil of the basin, drainage pattern, landform and longitudinal and cross profiles of the channels. On the basis of these studies, GSI produces flood hazard maps indicating Preparedness and Response Prohibitive, Restricted, Cautionary and Flood Free Zones. Significant flood related studies and recommendations made by GSI are as follows: \u2022 Brahmaputra Valley - a comprehensive geo-environmental data base for environmental management and flood control generated, \u2022 Lower Banas sub-basin - selective irrigation to prevent rise of groundwater table recommended, \u2022 Kandi basin in West Bengal- GSI recommended construction of small weirs to reduce impact \u2022 Mokameh Tal area in the Ganga Flood plain - rejuvenation of existing drainage channels to reduce flood problem recommended, \u2022 Lower Damodar Basin- diversion", "along artificial canals and re-excavation of old river channel \u2022 Landslide zonation map for Himalayan region, \u2022 The contribution of snow melting to annual flood. GSI\u2019s flood related studies are used by Central Water Commission, Water Resource Development Project Authorities, Urban and Rural Planning Authorities, Ministry of Environment and Forest, Ministry of Agriculture, etc. 5.10 Avalanche warning \u2013 Defence Research & Development Organization (DRDO) 29 5.10.1 DRDO was formed in 1958 with the amalgamation of the then already functioning technical development establishments of the Indian Army and the Directorate of Technical Development and projection with the Defence Science Organization. DRDO was then a small organization with 10 establishment or laboratories. Over the years it has grown as multi directionally in", "terms of the Variety of disciplines, number of laboratories, achievements and stature. 5.10.2 Today network of more than fifty laboratories are deeply engaged in developing Defence technologies. Center for Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) is one of the laboratories of the DRDO located at Chandigarh with its primary function to do research in the field of snow and avalanches and to provide avalanche control measures and forecasting support to Armed forces. The SASE is the nodal agency for issuing advisories and warnings about the avalanche in the country. 5.11 Disaster Management Support (DMS) \u2013 Indian Space Research Organization 5.11.1 The Space activities in the country started during early 1960s with the scientific investigation of upper atmosphere and ionosphere over", "the magnetic equator that passes over Thumba near Thiruvananthapuram using small sounding rockets Realising the immense potential of space technology for national development, Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, the visionary leader envisioned that this powerful technology could play a meaningful role in national development and solving the problems of common man. 5.11.2 The objective of ISRO is to develop space technology and its application to various national tasks. ISRO has established two major space systems, INSAT for communication, television broadcasting and meteorological services, and Indian Remote Sensing Satellites (IRS) system for resources monitoring and management. ISRO has developed two satellite launch vehicles, PSLV and GSLV, to place INSAT and IRS satellites in the required orbits. Accordingly, ISRO Disaster Management in India has", "successfully operationalised two major satellite systems namely Indian National Satellites (INSAT) for communication services and Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites for management of natural resources; also, Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) for launching IRS type of satellites and Geostationary Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) for launching INSAT type of satellites. 5.11.3 The Disaster Management Support (DMS) Programme of ISRO, provides timely support and services from aero-space systems, both imaging and communications, towards efficient management of disasters in the country.. The DMS programme addresses disasters such as flood, cyclone, drought, forest fire, landslide and Earthquake. These include creation of digital data base for facilitating hazard zonation, damage assessment, etc., monitoring of major natural disasters using satellite and aerial data; development of appropriate", "techniques and tools for decision support, establishing satellite based reliable communication network, deployment of emergency communication equipments and R&D towards early warning of disasters. 5.11.4 To support the total cycle of disaster (emergency) management for the country in near real time, the database creation is addressed through National Database for Emergency Management (NDEM), a GIS based repository of data. NDEM is envisaged to have core data, hazard-specific data and dynamic data in spatial as well as spatial form. 5.11.5 Airborne ALTM-DC data acquisition is being carried out for the flood prone basins in the country. The development of flight model of C band DMSAR is nearing completion. SAR data was acquired over selected basins using Development model of DMSAR.

The responders are required to undertake activities as per the SOPs issued in respect of such disasters. There may be scenario where early", "warning signals could be available and there may happen a disaster without any early warning. 5.18 Crisis Management Plan (CMP) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) 5.18.1 In accordance with National Crisis Management Plan 2003 of the Cabinet Secretariat, MHA has formulated its CMP 2004 and circulated it to all States and UTs. The CMP of MHA comprises of two parts; Part-I deals with aspects, which are common to all contingencies situations and Part-II about the individual Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for dealing with specific crisis situation. SOPs are preparedness plan which emerges and activates the procedure for response on receipt of calamity or receipt of figure of impending disaster. It identifies the financial and administration powers to the people made", "responsible for the procedure. 5.18.2 The CMP of MHA is reviewed periodically. It was last reviewed in 2009 and was circulated to all Ministries and Departments of Central Government as well as States and UTs. An SOP for management of Natural Disasters formulated by this Ministry has also been circulated vide this Ministry\u2019s letter No.32-35/2003-NDM-I dated 21-04-2009. 5.18.3 The State Governments have been advised to formulate the similar kind of the CMP and SOPs. MHA has conducted number of training workshops for the States and UTs for assisting them in formulation of the SOPs. 5.19 Role and Responsibility of Central and State Governments 5.19.1 Ministry of Home Affairs is the nodal Ministry for management of natural disasters (other than drought,", "hailstorm and pest attack, which are handled by Ministry of Agriculture) on behalf of the Government of India. Disaster Management Division (DM Division) performs the function in the Ministry of Home Affairs. 5.19.2 The Central and State Governments are jointly responsible for undertaking relief, rehabilitation, preparedness, mitigation and response measures. The basic responsibility for undertaking these measures in the event of a disaster rests with the concerned State Government. The Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments by providing logistic and financial support in case of natural calamities of severe nature. The logistic support includes Disaster Management in India deployment of aircrafts and boats, specialist teams of Armed Forces, Central Paramilitary Forces and personnel of National Disaster Response", "Force (NDRF), arrangements for relief materials & essential commodities including medical stores, restoration of critical infrastructure facilities including communication network and such other assistance as may be required by the affected States to meet the situation effectively. 5.19.3 DM Division of MHA closely monitors the disaster and disaster like situation to facilitate strategic interventions in the form of logistic and financial support by the Government of India to augment the resources of the affected States and UTs to deal effectively with each disaster situation. For this purpose close liaison is made with the affected States on the one side and the concerned Central line Ministries such as Ministry of Health, Ministry of Defence Ministry of Civil Aviation, Food and Civil", "Supplies etc on the other. 5.20 Inter Agency Co-ordination Mechanism Co-ordination at the Central and the State level is achieved by way of various committees involving all departments that are working in Disaster management. A response set-up across the country may be viewed in Figure 5.1. 5.21 Cabinet Committee on Management of Natural Calamities It is constituted to \u2022 Oversee all aspects relating to management of natural calamities including assessment of the situation and identification of measures considered necessary to reduce its impact, \u2022 Examine and implement programmes for reducing the adverse impact of natural calamities, \u2022 Monitor and suggest long term measures for prevention of such calamities in the future; and, \u2022 Formulate and recommend programmes for public awareness", "for building up society\u2019s resilience to natural calamities. The Committee is to be serviced by Ministry of Home Affairs in all cases except in cases relating to Drought Management and Epidemics when it is serviced, as the case may be, by the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation and Department of Health and Family Welfare. 5.22 National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) At the Centre, under the Chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary the NCMC has been constituted in the Cabinet Secretariat. The other members of this Committee include the Secretary to the Prime Minister, Secretaries of the Ministries of Home Affairs, Defence, Information & Broadcasting, RAW, NDMA, Deputy NSA and Director of Intelligence Bureau.

The Joint Secretary (DM) is the Convener of CMG for natural disasters. 5.24 Role of the State Government 5.24.1 In the context of federal set-up of India, the responsibility to formulate the Governments response to a natural calamity is essentially that of the concerned State Government. However, the Central Government, with its resources, physical and financial does provide the needed help and assistance to buttress", "relief efforts in the wake of major natural disasters. The dimensions of the response at the level of National Government are determined in accordance with the existing policy of financing the relief expenditure and keeping in view the factors like. (i) gravity of a natural calamity, (ii) scale of the relief operation necessary, and (iii) Requirements of Central assistance for augmenting the financial resources at the disposal of the State Government. 5.24.2 Most of the States have Relief Commissioners under the Department of Disaster Management, who are in charge of the relief measures in the wake of natural disasters. In the absence of the Relief Commissioner, the Chief Secretary or an Officer nominated by him is in overall charge of", "the Relief operations in the concerned State. 5.24.3 At the state level, the State Relief Commissioner supervises and controls relief operations through Collectors or Deputy Commissioners, who are the main functionaries to coordinate the relief operation at district level. The State Governments are autonomous in organizing relief operations in the event of natural disasters and in developing the long-term rehabilitation measures. The State Government\u2019s efforts are supplemented by central Government based on the recommendations of the Finance Commission. 5.25 State Crisis Management Group (SCMG) 5.25.1 There is a State Crisis Management Group (SCMG) under the Chairmanship of Chief Secretary and Relief Commissioner. This Group comprises senior officers from the Departments of Revenue/relief, Home, Civil Supplies, Power, Irrigation, Water Supply, Panchayat", "(local self- government), Agriculture, Forests, rural Development, and health, Planning, Public Works and 5.25.2 The SCMG is required to take into consideration the guidance received, from time to time, from Government of India and formulate action plans for dealing with different natural disasters. It is also the duty of the Relief Commissioner of the State to establish a Emergency Operation Center (Control Room) at State headquarters as soon as a disaster situation develops. Besides having all updated information on forecasting and warning of disaster, the EOC would also be the contact point for the various concerned agencies. 5.26 Role of District Administration 5.26.1 The district Administration is the focal point for field level organizations. It is responsible for implementation of", "all government contingency plans. Considerable powers have therefore been wrested upon the District Collector to carry out operations in the shortest possible time. Preparedness and Response 5.26.2 The District Administration in the country is required to prepare an advance Contingency Plan depending on the type of disaster likely to affect the district. Contingency Plans are to follow a framework as laid down nationally which comprises type of preparedness, the relief material required to be mobilized and the concerned departments that need to work together and provide an efficient feedback and monitoring system. 5.26.3 The District Magistrate exercises coordinating and supervisory powers over functionaries of all the Departments at the district level in the event of emergencies. During actual operations for", "disaster mitigation or relief, the powers of the Collector are considerably enhanced, generally, by standing instructions or orders on the subject, or by specific Governments orders, if so required. Sometimes, the administrative culture of the State concerned permits, although informally, the collector to exercise higher powers in emergency situations and the decisions are later ratified by the competent authority. 5.26.4 District Relief Committee: The district level Relief Committee consisting of official and non-official members including the local Legislators and the Members of Parliament reviews the relief measures. 5.27 Role of Sub-district Administration A District is sub-divided into sub-divisions and Tehsils or Talukas. The head of a sub-division is called the Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO) while the head of a Tehsil is", "generally known as the Tehsildar (Talukdar or Mamlatdar in some States). Contact with the individual villages is through the village Officer or Patwari who has one or more villages in his charge. When a disaster is apprehended, the entire machinery of the District, including officers of technical and other Departments, swings into action and maintains almost continuous contact with each village in the disaster threatened area. In the case of extensive disasters like drought, contact is maintained over a short cycle of a few days. The entire hierarchy right from the Central Government (the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation in the Ministry of Agriculture and irrigation) to the District level is connected by means of a telecommunication system. 5.28 National", "Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) 5.28.1 The National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) in the Ministry of Home Affairs functions 24X7 to monitor the disaster or disaster like situation. Based on the feedback received from National Forecasting Agencies viz Indian Meteorological Department, Central Water Commission, Snow & Avalanche Study Establishment etc. advisories to the concerned States/UTs are issued from time to time for keeping watch on the developing situation and take necessary measures such as evacuation of the vulnerable persons, operation of relief camps, pre positioning of essential commodities etc. 5.28.2 During the south west monsoon, daily situation reports (sitreps) are prepared based on the feedback received from the affected States and concerned Central Ministries and organizations, and are sent to all", "concerned. During the calamities of severe nature, special situation reports are also prepared and issued to all concerned. NEOC also issue SMS alerts to the concerned Disaster Management in India officers in MHA, PMO and Cabinet Secretariat. These reports are also uploaded on the website www.ndmindia.nic.in.. 5.29 State Control Room There is a State Level Control Room set up whenever a disaster situation develops. The Control Room is responsible for: (i) Transmitting information about the development of a crisis as a result of natural disaster on continued basis to the Central Relief Commissioner. (ii) Receiving instructions and communicating them to appropriate agencies for immediate (iii) Collection and submission of information relating to implementation of relief measures to the Central Relief", "Commissioner; and (iv) Keeping the State level authorities apprised of the developments on a continuing basis. 5.30 District Control Room Likewise in the wake of natural disasters, a Control Room is set up in the district for day-to- day monitoring of the rescue and relief operations on a continuing basis, operationalising the contingency plan and keep close liaison with the State Headquarters, NGOs and other agencies dealing with disaster management and relief. 5.31 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) 5.31.1 Task and role of NDRF: The main task of NDRF is to provide specialist response in case of disasters which broadly covers: \u2022 NBC disasters ( Decontamination of the area and personnel) \u2022 Removal of debris \u2022 Extrication of victims- live", "or dead Mock drill by NDRF, Mangalore Preparedness and Response \u2022 First medical response to victims \u2022 Extend moral support to victims \u2022 Assistance to civil authorities in distribution of relief material \u2022 Co-ordination with sister agencies \u2022 Capacity building countries, if asked 5.31.2 Specialized equipment for NDRF Battalions: In NDRF has been equipped with latest and state of the art equipments required for the rescue and relief works. 310 different types of equipments have been authorized to NDRF which broadly consist of Medical First Responder (MFR) Equipments, Collapsed Structure Search & Rescue (CSSR), water rescue, CBRN equipments, specialist vehicle etc. The details of such equipment may be visited at www. 5.31.3 Other activities of NDRF: NDRF is engaged in", "following other activities beside search and rescue operation undertaken during emergency situation. \u2022 Conducting familiarisation exercise in order to acquaint personnel with vulnerability of their area of responsibility to different disasters NDRF in action for rescue operation - Bihar floods Box 5.4: Rescue and relief measures leading to further disasters - Tamil Nadu experience Inadequate planning and preparation in rescue and relief may lead to further disasters. \u2013 \u201c42 persons die in a stampede at Chennai flood relief camp - They came in droves seeking relief from their tragedy, instead they fell victim to another tragedy as a stampede on Sunday (18th December 2005) at a relief camp for flood victims in Chennai which left 42 people dead and 40", "injured.

NDRF has saved 1, 41,257 human lives and retrieved 362 dead bodies of disaster victims in various response operations in", "Table 5.2: NDRF : Response Activities No. of Activities Dead bodies retrieved 5. 32 State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) The States/UTs have also been advised to set up their own Specialist Response force for responding to disasters on the lines of National Disaster Response Force vide Ministry of Home Affairs letter dt 26th July 2007 and vide this Ministry\u2019s letter dated 08 March 2011. The Central Government is providing assistance for training of trainers. The State Governments have been also advised to utilize 10% of their State Disaster Response Fund and Capacity Building Grant for the procurement of search and rescue equipment and for training purposes of the Response 5.33 Policy for Acceptance of External Assistance The present policy of", "Government of India is to not issue a formal appeal on behalf of the Government, either directly or through any other agency, to attract relief. However, relief donated on a voluntary basis are accepted and acknowledged as a sign of international solidarity. There is no objection to NGO\u2019s issuing appeals for donations provided it is clear that the appeals are not at the instance of the Government of India. In the case of UN organisations and agencies (like OCHA) such appeals would imply endorsement by member countries and they are advised against appeals for international assistance. Preparedness and Response 5.34 Drought Relief Measures 5.34.1 Management of drought has now been outlined in much elaborated manner in the drought manual issued", "by ministry of Agriculture and cooperation. 5.34.2 Following drought declaration, planning and implementation of drought relief and response measures is initiated. It is necessary that these measures are undertaken promptly so that it would mitigate the hardship faced by the people. Though these measures are sector specific, they require immense inter department coordination. Implementing these measures would require a continuous flow of information from the village level to the highest level of decision making in the State and a responsive administrative structure. It would also require careful financial planning so that the implementation of these measures could be undertaken on a sustained basis. 5.34.3 Contingency crop planning: Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), State", "Government agriculture departments and agricultural universities need to prepare the contingency crop plan and disseminate it among farmers with the help to support agencies, mentioned below. The alternative crop planning involves choosing suitable crops and / or crop varieties, alternative crop strategies, mid season\u2019s corrections and crop life saving measures. 5.34.4 Relief employment: The most important relief component is the generation of employment provision during the drought period. As soon as drought is declared, it is therefore, necessary for the State Governments to immediately start relief employment programmes and provide work to those who need employment within a radius of five kilometers. 5.34.5 Most State Governments have their own food for work programme. The Government of India has started the", "National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), providing 100 days of employment to one person per family on demand. The scheme has been extended to the entire country. A large number of public works and watershed programmes could be supported through the NREGS. These programmes together can create substantial employment to tide over the hardship and deprivation caused by drought. 5.34.6 Water resource management: Water resource management in the drought affected areas is one of the most critical tasks of relief operations. It requires diverse measures such as augmentation of water supply, rationing of water use, and efficient utilization and management of water resources, in both urban and rural areas. Shortage of water is one of the earliest indicators of drought,", "affecting the entire society, rural and urban. Assessing the demand for water and its total availability in a specific region, therefore, is extremely important for meeting the needs of different user groups. 5.34.7 Food security Food security is one of the most important objectives of drought management. It is provided through food for work programmes, which are started by the State Governments to provide relief employment. Wages on these relief employment works are paid in the form of foodgrains, on a full or partial basis. 5.34.8 The National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), extended to all the districts across the country, guarantees employment opportunities in the rural areas by providing work that taps labour intensive community assets. It assures manual", "work to one person per family for a maximum of 100 days in a year. Disaster Management in India 5.34.9 Relief through tax waivers and concessions : The primary objective of the tax waivers and concessions would be to help people meet their basic entitlements. The State Government can take a conscious decision to provide a number of tax waivers and concessions when a drought is declared. These tax waivers and concessions should be decided on the basis of the entitlement needs of certain segments of the population and the fiscal implications of such a relief to the State Government. Each State Government may decide on tax waivers and concessions to the people affected by drought, depending on fiscal situation", "of the State and severity 5.34.10 Cattle camps and fodder supply: State Governments need to support their farmers in protecting their cattle population during a drought assistance for fodder, feed, and cattle health. During a drought situation, every measure needs to be taken to save useful cattle. When cattle wealth is seriously depleted the recovery is very slow. While sheep and goats have a potential for rapid growth, perhaps 25% a year or more, the growth of cow, buffaloes and camels is much slower, rarely more than 1-2% a year in a sustained manner. It is necessary to provide support to farmers for fodder so that they do not engage in distress selling of their cattle. 5.34.11 Health and hygiene:", "In a drought situation, health issues are largely related to contamination of water and spread of infection among the workers participating in public works programmes. People have less immunity in drought situations due to poor levels of nutrition. Necessary precautions need to be taken to prevent the spread of any water borne epidemic and other infectious diseases. 5.34.12 Institutional response: Drought management requires a strong institutional structure to monitor and provide a timely response to drought. While it is primarily the responsibility of the State Government to manage drought, the Central Government also plays an important role in monitoring drought and providing financial assistance to the States. The district administration headed by the Collector plays the most critical role in", "responding to drought on the ground. At the Central level, the Ministry of Agriculture is the department responsible for drought monitoring and management. 5.34.13 Role of Panchayati Raj institutions: It is necessary to involve the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) \u2013 Zila Parishads, Panchayat Samitis and village Panchayats in the implementation of drought management programmes. School preparedness; Photo: seedsindia.org Preparedness and Response 5.34.14 Financing relief expenditure: In post independent India, financing relief expenditure has largely been arranged through the Finance Commission appointed under Article 280 of the Constitution. In the earlier phases the role of the Commission was restricted to suggesting the pattern of financial assistance by the centre. Subsequently the recommendations were enlarged to cover the \u201cscheme of financing relief", "expenditure\u201d. 5.34.15 Information management and media coordination :The Central and State Governments should provide information on all aspects of drought to the people and media. It is necessary to inform the people about the severity and impact of drought and the measures being taken to alleviate the drought situation. The preparedness and response phase in the Disaster management cycle are critical in reducing the impact of disasters. The involvement of multi-various stakeholders, therefore, need to ensure efficient inter-departmental coordination and need to constantly review and improve the systems in place. It has to be kept in mind to ensure that the focus on these two areas help in bringing a tangible improvement in handling the disasters. Disaster Management in India6", "6.1.1 The International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) defines recovery as the \u201cdecisions and actions taken after a disaster with a view to restore or improve the pre-disaster living conditions of the stricken community, while encouraging and facilitating necessary adjustments to reduce disaster risk\u201d. 6.1.2 While emergency response is vital as it is aimed at saving human lives and providing relief, the ultimate objective of any crisis management is restoration of devastated livelihoods. Recovery efforts following rescue and relief in any disaster can be classified into short term and long term. The short term activities for recovery are debris clearance, providing semi-permanent shelter and ensuring sanitation and restoring lifelines, while the long term activities involve building a safer and more", "sustainable livelihood. 6.2 Nature of Recovery 6.2.1 The damage caused by floods, earthquakes and cyclones is on a much larger scale than other disasters and recovery after these disasters poses a challenge. In disasters like drought, the relief phase is prolonged and since there is no damage to the infrastructure and property, the rehabilitation is confined to restoration of livelihoods which can get subsumed in normal development programmes. 6.2.2 Recovery in case of epidemics is more in the form of sanitising the locality against any future recurrence and may also involve counseling of the victims. Industrial disasters being quite varied in nature, the rehabilitation in major ones like the \u2018Bhopal Gas Tragedy\u2019 could involve rehabilitation efforts spanning over a generation", "of victims apart from restoring livelihoods and providing social and psychological assistance. 6.2.3 Rehabilitation following disasters such as landslides and avalanches is localised and is of a similar nature as in earthquakes but on a smaller scale. Finding safer sites near such locations often poses challenges and resistance. 6.3 Guiding Principles for Post-Recovery Box 6.1 illustrates the principles applied generally based on international practices. Box 6.1: Guiding Principles for Post- Recovery \u2022 Mainstreaming disaster risk reduction in recovery and development process, \u2022 Improving coordination, \u2022 Promoting participatory approaches and decentralising planning and programming for recovery, \u2022 Enhancing safety standards and integrating risk reduction in reconstruction and development, \u2022 Improving the living conditions of the affected communities and sectors, \u2022 Building", "local and national capacities for increased resilience, risk management and sustainable \u2022 Taking advantage of ongoing initiatives, \u2022 Gender sensibility, \u2022 Demonstrative effects, \u2022 Monitoring, evaluation and learning. Disaster Management in India The first step after stabilizing the situation by providing sufficient relief is to assess the damage. A meticulously executed assessment exercise would provide an ideal base for the rehabilitation efforts. This exercise is best carried out through multi-disciplinary teams which go into all aspects of damage (social, economical, psychological) in participation with the local community. Based on the assessment of the damage and the needs, a recovery strategy has to be formulated. The strategy should include all interventions - economic, social, political and psychological. The resources should be", "identified and the roles and responsibilities of all concerned should be 6.5 Co-ordination 6.5.1 Following any major disaster, a number of players arrive on the scene and as already stated, ensuring proper coordination amongst them thus becomes very important. Recovery activities are taken up by government agencies, local bodies, international agencies, voluntary organisations and others, through separate, overlapping and uncoordinated interventions. This leads to imbalances in the scale of operations, duplication of efforts in some areas, gaps in others and leakage and misuse of resources. Therefore establishing a framework for coordination is necessary for effective recovery. The role of voluntary organisations including international ones like the Red Cross is extremely useful for mitigating the impact of disaster. 6.5.2 The administration", "is also required to set up a voluntary organisations\u2019 coordination centre to coordinate the relief and rehabilitation activities of the multiple organisations so that they are not concentrated in a few pockets. It is often observed that post-disaster recovery efforts tend to focus on rapid and visible solutions to restore normalcy at the cost of sustainable development. The post-disaster recovery phase provides a \u2018window of opportunity\u2019 for disaster risk reduction. Risk reduction aspects should therefore be built into the redevelopment process. Shelter is one of the most visible and immediate needs in post-crisis settings. Relief efforts are often focused on providing shelter quickly, without taking into account the impact of short- term shelter strategies. Long-term shelter strategies help not only", "to focus on determination and implementation of realistic and permanent reconstruction plans for the affected communities, but are also concerned with rebuilding community confidence and support structure for civic responsibility and urban governance, through participatory planning of reconstruction. The development of disaster resistant housing is a major factor in reducing vulnerability to disasters. However, shelter issues in mitigation go beyond the structural aspects. Rights to ownership and security of tenure make an enormous difference to the maintenance, management and development of shelter, particularly in urban areas. 6.7 Sustainability in Recovery Process Normally, it is seen that the recovery efforts have a tendency of tapering off with the passage of time. The Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery of the UNDP", "has also observed \u201cthe general experience is that once the initial flurry of activities of providing rescue and relief is over, the attention received by the recovery efforts goes on declining steadily over a period of time and \u2018business as usual\u2019 sets in\u201d. The sustainability component in recovery process therefore is important. This could be achieved by capability building of the community and awareness generation and preparing local crisis management plans. Recovery Reconstruction and Rehabilitation 6.8 Accountability A system of accountability needs to be evolved during the relief and rehabilitation phase. This system should ensure that the relief material reaches the target groups and that the funds are being utilised efficiently and optimally. A grievance redressal mechanism should also be", "put in place. After the recovery phase, it is necessary to conduct a detailed evaluation of all aspects of crisis management. This should bring out the strengths and weaknesses of the disaster management machinery and also provide the basis for future improvements. Such an evaluation should be carried out by an independent professional agency like the NIDM, in all major disasters. This assessment should also include a quick audit of the expenditure incurred. 6.10 Guidance Notes on Recovery The International Recovery Platform (IRP) and United Nations Development Programme India have developed Guidance Notes on Recovery on nine sectors namely Shelter, Infrastructure, Gender, Livelihood, Environment, Governance, Climate Change, Health and Psycho-social support. These are initial steps in documenting, collecting and sharing", "disaster recovery experiences and lessons. This collection of the successes and failures of past experiences in disaster recovery is expected to help in the planning and implementation of future recovery initiatives. The aim of the guidance notes is not to recommend actions, but to place before the personnel involved in the risk-reducing recovery process a menu of options. The sector specific Guidance Notes are primarily intended for use by policymakers, planners, and implementers of local, regional and national government bodies interested or engaged in facilitating a more responsive, sustainable, and risk reducing recovery process. Since the governments are not the sole actors in disaster recovery and IRP believes that the experiences collected in this document can benefit many other partners", "working together to build back better. These Guidance Notes on different sectors are available on their website www.recoveryplatform.org. 6.11 Some Indian Experiences in Recovery in the Last Two Decades Few experiences of post disaster recovery rehabilitation and reconstruction works are illustrated in the subsequent paras. This shows the experiences which country as a whole has gathered in course of its recovery process after the event of different kind of disasters whether human induced or natural. This may guide the responders in the future such endeavors and may also help them to take corrective measures. 6.12 Bhopal Gas Tragedy (1984) 6.12.1 The Bhopal Gas Tragedy is one of the world\u2019s worst industrial catastrophes. It occurred on the night of 2-3 December,", "1984 at the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) Pesticide plant in Bhopal which was the Indian subsidiary of Union Carbide Corporation, USA. The accident occurred due to leakage of Methyl Iso Cynate (MIC) and other chemicals due to ingression of water and the resulting reaction affected a large number of persons. Approximately 2000 people are known to have died in the first 72 hours and large proportion of the survivors suffered acute multi-system morbidities (eyes and lungs were the target organs). The ICMR estimated that approximately 62.58% of the total population in Bhopal suffered from inhalational toxicity. The people who resided in areas close to the carbide factory were exposed to higher concentration of potentially lethal toxic gases. Disaster Management", "in India 6.12.2 A large proportion of population who survived this tragedy developed morbidity of varying degree over the last 25 years. As an immediate response, the state government of Madhya Pradesh provided financial support to the affected families and an amount of `.12.80 crore was distributed as immediate relief. Food items were also distributed to the affected population and compensation was paid for livestock loss. An amount of ` 3.78 crore was spent to provide compensation to the families of a deceased. 6.12.3 During 1990 in the first five year action plan a sum of ` 258 Crore was sanctioned by the Central government and it got extended till 1999. This plan provided ` 150.35 crore for medical rehabilitation", "in addition to economic rehabilitation (` 21.18 crore), social rehabilitation (` 49.72 crore) and environmental rehabilitation (` 23.76 crore). The present action plan for Rehabilitation of Government of Madhya Pradesh is given in Table: 6.1 includes the following features: Department of relief and rehabilitation, Government of Madhya Pradesh Department of relief and rehabilitation, Government of Madhya Pradesh Recovery Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Table 6.1: Action Plan for Rehabilitation of Government of Madhya Pradesh Amount (in ` Crore) Medical Rehabilitation Social Rehabilitation Economic Rehabilitation 6.12.4 Committee of Group of Ministers A \u2018Group of Ministers\u2019 has been constituted by GOI under the chairmanship of Home Minister to take decisions on all issues related to Bhopal Gas tragedy vide note 47/1/7/93-CAB dated 26/05/2010. There", "are 10 members in the Group of Ministers. The \u2018Group of Ministers\u2019 have come out with the ` 982.75 crore work plan (75:25 sharing pattern) for Economic, Social, Medical and Environmental rehabilitation of victim of Bhopal Gas Tragedy. Central Government has sanctioned ` 272.75 crore to Madhya Pradesh Government. 6.13 Kutch Earthquake (2001) The Kutch earthquake of 26th January, 2001 was one of the worst natural disasters to strike in Gujarat. It posed enormous challenges because of its magnitude, intensity and geographical spread for rescue, relief and rehabilitation. 6.13.1 The devastation \u2013a glimpse: Overall 7633 villages in 21 out of 25 districts of Gujarat were affected to varying degrees. The districts most affected were Kutch, Surendaranagar, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Patan and", "Ahmedabad. Almost 13, 805 human lives were lost, about 1,67,000 persons Gujarat Earthquake 2001 Disaster Management in India were injured and over a million houses were damaged and destroyed. About 10,000 small and medium industrial units went out of production, affecting income and employment. Inspite of the immediate sense of shock, confusion, helplessness and grief, the government and the community rose to the occasion and quickly responded to the event. Soon after, a holistic and comprehensive reconstruction and rehabilitation programme was put in place. A new organization, the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority was established. The Government of Gujarat also announced the Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Policy (2001). 6.13.2 The Gujarat Earthquake Reconstruction Programme was designed to address the needs of", "the affected people comprehensively. It adopted a building back better approach, involved the community and encompassed a number of sectors such as housing physical infrastructure, social infrastructure (education and health), urban reconstruction, livelihood restoration, social rehabilitation and long term disaster risk reduction. 6.13.3 The reconstruction programme had the following objectives: (i) Promoting sustainable recovery in disaster affected areas, and (ii) Laying the foundation for sustainable disaster management capacity in Gujarat. The phase-wise focus of the programme is summarised as follows: (a) The short term focus of the reconstruction programme was to address the immediate needs such as temporary shelters before the onset of the monsoon, debris removal, repair of houses and public buildings and emergency repair of irrigation structures. Kutch", "earthquake 2001 and reconstruction of house Recovery Reconstruction and Rehabilitation (b) The medium term objectives of the programme emphasised the repair and reconstruction of houses, public infrastructure, and social infrastructure and initiating efforts towards disaster mitigation and reduction. (c) The long term objective of the reconstruction programme was further strengthening the capacity of government institutions and community towards disaster risk reduction (preparedness, response, mitigation and prevention) and implementation of risk transfer 6.13.4 Some of the salient features of the Gujarat Reconstruction Programme are as follows: (i) Owner Driven Reconstruction: The reconstruction of the houses was done by the owners themselves with technical assistance provided by the government. This involved minimum relocation and out of 215,255 houses that were reconstructed only", "5720 houses were partially relocated. To provide technical guidance to the community and ensure that the newly built houses were hazard resistant, large number of engineers, architects and masons were trained and technical guidelines were developed. A third party audit mechanism was established to control quality. (ii) Housing Insurance: The Housing Insurance Programme was incorporated as a compulsory component for all G-5 houses and optional for houses of other categories. The insurance covered 14 types of risks for 10 years and the premium was fixed at ` 349.10 for an insured (iii) Urban reconstruction of all the four towns in Kutch ensured planning principles with improvement of basic services and urban environment. (iv) A regulatory system for safe construction was", "strengthened and licensing of engineers and certification of masons were introduced. (v) Mass awareness on disaster preparedness was undertaken to prepare the community to face similar future eventualities. 6.14 Tsunami (2004) 6.14.1 The Dec 26th 2004 Indian ocean tsunami caused extensive damage to the infrastructure including harbours, jetties, roads, bridges, power, telecom, hospitals, schools and other social sector buildings besides human loss of 9395 persons and 3,964 were missing after the disaster. The estimated loss in monetary terms including damage to property was reported at ` 11544.91 crore (Andhra Pradesh- ` 342.67 crore, Kerala- ` 2371.02 crore, Tamil Nadu- ` 4528.66 crore, Andman & Nicobar Islands ` 3836.56 and Puducherry \u2013 ` 466.00 crore). In terms of housing, 86,688 houses", "were damaged, with 53,192 vulnerable to damage. Approximately 12000 hectares of agricultural land was damaged and 3000 hectares of land was rendered unusable due to salinity in the soil. A total 47 Fishing Landing Centres (FLC) got damaged and approximately 28000 boats were damaged. The loss assessed by respective state government may be seen at Table 6.2. Disaster Management in India Table 6.2: Loss in Tsunami 2004, India 6.14.2 It is not possible to prevent a tsunami. However, in some tsunami-prone countries, earthquake engineering measures have been taken to reduce the damage caused on shore. Physical Measures: The State Governments and District Administration rose to the occasion in its search & rescue operation besides providing relief. The Central Government initiated", "relief operation by deploying 20,800 personnel of armed forces as well as Central Armed Police Forces in the affected States and UTs. It also send supports to Sri Lanka, Maldives and Indonesia. In all 881 relief camps were set-up and a total of 6,04,335 people were housed Tsunami in Indian Ocean Recovery Reconstruction and Rehabilitation in these camps. About 12,735 tents were dispatched to the affected areas \u2013 mostly to A&N Islands. 64 special flights were operated between 27th Dec 2004 \u2013 1st Jan 2005 to evacuate 6,318 stranded people including tourists in A&N Islands. In all 28,734 persons were rescued \u2013 9950 in Kerala, 9284 in A&N Islands, and 9500 in TN including 1000 persons stranded at Vivekanand Memorial.", "6.45 lakhs persons \u2013 Main Land (6.30 lakhs) and A&N Islands (0.15 lakhs) were moved to safer places. (ii) Financial Measures: Government of India made immediate release of ` 700 crore for the Tsunami affected States and UTs. An amount of ` 450 crore was released as an immediate assistance from the National Calamity Contingency Fund (NCCF) to the States of Tamil Nadu (` 250 crore), Kerala (` 100 crore) and Andhra Pradesh (` 100 crore). In addition, an amount of ` 50 crore to Puducherry and ` 200 crore for Andaman & Nicobar Islands was (iii) Rajiv Gandhi Rehabilitation Package: Government of India provided assistance to the Governments of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and the Union Territories of", "Puducherry and Andaman & Nicobar Islands to implement the special package of ` 3644.05 crore named as \u201cRajiv Gandhi Rehabilitation Package for Tsunami affected areas\u201d to provide assistance for immediate relief and response, revival of fishery and agriculture sectors, construction of temporary (intermediate) shelters and repair/restoration of infrastructure. The amount of ` 700 crore released immediately from NCCF became a part of this \u2018Package\u2019. The details of release are given as under in Table 6.3.

The river is notorious for its vagaries and known to change its bed very often. During the last two centuries, the river has been", "changing its course in the westerly directions and it has laterally moved nearly 70 miles. On 18.08.2008 the Kosi river started eroding the spurs on the eastern efflux bundh 12 km. up stream of the Birpur barrage in Supaul district and breached the embankment. After the breach, the entire river spilled out and started flowing along a new course running straight down south. The course of the river was approximately 15 to 20 km wide and 150 km long north to south. The entire country side within this 3000 sq. kms. was totally devastated by the rapid surging flow of the river along its new course. Houses, schools, roads, dispensaries were all flooded and swept away. A total of 35", "blocks, 407 panchayats and 980 villages in five districts with a total population of 33, 89, 000 fell along the new course of the river. Totally, 217 people and 868 cattle were killed and 3,38,986 houses were partly or fully damaged due to the catastrophe. 6.15.2 Immediate Response: The affected areas had never experienced such a catastrophe and had not seen floods for the last 50 years, therefore they had inadequate arrangements to face the situation. The state administration deployed 1500 boats locally in addition to the 561 motor boats mobilised from NDRF, army, navy and other sources. About 12 helicopters carried out 314 sorties and air dropped about 1, 21, 892 packets of food, water and halogen tablets besides", "distribution of about 2, 39, 858 food packets by boats to the people in the affected areas. The state government carried out one of the largest evacuation operations of about 9, 93, 992 persons ever organised in the country. About 5000 civilian personnel, 3500 police men, 35 Source: Flood Management System, Water Resources Department Bihar Disaster Management in India columns of army, 4 columns of the navy, 850 personnel of NDRF, 1500 boats and 560 motor boats were deployed for the evacuation. 6.15.3 Mega Shelter Camps: The State Government set up 362 relief camps in the buildings of schools and colleges. At the peak of the disaster 4, 40,739 people were living in the camps. Self help groups were constituted", "to look after the preparation and distribution of meals. A special thrust was on women and newly born babies; clothes and utensils were given to each camp inmate as relief measures. Other features of the shelter are outlined below: constructed, 2,155 hand pumps installed in the camps, generators and solar lamps provided for lighting in the camps, \u2022 Schools set up for the children in the camp and 56,304 children enrolled in these schools, \u2022 Anganwadi Centres set up in each major \u2022 Skill development programmes initiated and training provided to willing persons in handicrafts and cottage industries, \u2022 Health sub-centres set up in each camp with doctors on duty round the clock with provision for free medicines and camps", "were also covered by a mobile team. A total of 491 doctors and 1578 paramedical staff deployed on a daily basis. Maternity huts set up in relief camps and 183 deliveries reported in these maternity centres, \u2022 A total of 108 ambulances were deployed. Owner driven construction under Kosi recovery programme Recovery Reconstruction and Rehabilitation 6.15.4 Livestock: To cater to the affected livestock, 257 veterinary centres manned by 387 personnel were set up. As per the report 47,430 animals were kept in camps and 321630 animals were vaccinated. Box 6. 2: Kosi Flood Reconstruction And Rehabilitation Programme Background: The state government has formulated Kosi Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project with the purpose of reconstructing the houses, providing community facilities, complete restoration", "of physical infrastructure, livelihood support based on the policy of sustained economy and environment etc for the people affected by the calamity. The project is based on the success of the pilot Kosi Recovery and Reconstruction project supported by the UNDP in two villages through the Owner Driven Reconstruction Collaborative network of civil society organisations. Components: The World Bank aided project Kosi Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project has the following major components: Owner Driven Housing Reconstruction - Using an owner driven reconstruction model, about 1000,000 houses will be built with a brick and concrete plinth, bamboo superstructure and corrugated galvanized iron (CGI) sheeting roof. The cost per house will be ` 55,000 with a currently estimated cost of ` 2,300 for", "a toilet and ` 5,000) for solar powered lighting. (ii) Reconstruction of Roads and Bridges \u2013 Under this component, connectivity lost due to the Kosi flood would be restored by reconstruction of damaged roads and bridges/culverts, including construction of some new bridges. The project is expected to construct about 90 bridges and culverts on the State Highway and Major District Roads and reconstruct about 290 km of rural roads, which would benefit around 2.2 million people. New cross drainage structures will be provided where new streams have formed and where these were missing earlier. (iii) Strengthening Flood Management Capacity - This component would strengthen the overall flood forecasting and flood and sediment management capacity in Bihar by enhancing knowledge, understanding,", "and capacity of flood and sediment management. This will be achieved by implementing both structural and non-structural measures, mainly focusing on the Kosi River Basin. The component has three subcomponents: Knowledge management and capacity building; Flood forecasting and early warning; and Structural investments. (iv) Livelihood Restoration and Enhancement \u2013 The component is to build social and financial capital and expand the livelihood opportunities of the affected people of Madhepura, Supaul and Saharsa. This component will have four subcomponents: (i) Community Institution Development; (ii) Community Investment Fund; (iii) Technical Assistance Fund; and (iv) Project Management. (v) Improving Emergency Response Capacity \u2013 This component aims at making contingency funding available for civil works, consultant services and goods required to respond in case", "of future (vi) Project Management and Implementation Support \u2013This component is to support project implementation through the provision of necessary offices including equipment. Finance: Total Cost of the World bank aided project formulated by the Government is $220 million about 6.16 Leh Cloudburst (2010) 6.16.1 A rare phenomenon, a rainfall of 12.8mm during the intervening night of 5/6th August 2010 coupled with cloud burst resulted in flash floods and mud slides causing havoc and large scale loss of life and public infrastructure/private property particularly in Leh region. Besides the Disaster Management in India local population large numbers of tourists both Indian and foreign nationals, as well as labourers from outside the region who had gone there for earning a livelihood", "got trapped to face the most tragic and difficult circumstances. 6.16.2 Response: More than 6000 personnel of Army, Air Force, Border Roads Organization, National Disaster Response Force and Indo Tibetan Border Police were deployed along with rescue equipment to assist the civil administration in relief operations. Large quantities of relief material Damage by cloud Burst, 2010 Temporary Shelters, 2010 such as tents, blankets, tarpaulins, mattresses, food packets and bottled water were provided. Contributions from the charitable organisations and other sources were also sent. Apart from the medical teams available with army, CPMFs, state, etc. one medical team consisting of 08 Doctors and 04 Nurses along with 10 quintals of emergent surgical/medical consumables were deployed in the affected area from Delhi.", "Additional medical supplies and medical equipments were sent to the affected areas. A total of 55 civil aircrafts were operated and more than 8000 people were evacuated. The Air Force also carried out 226 sorties and airlifted 302 tonnes of relief material and equipments and 818 persons. Funds to the tune of ` 429.24 crore ($ 95 million) were available with the state government in their State Disaster Response Fund for undertaking immediate relief activities. The Prime Minister announced a rehabilitation package of ` 125 crore 6.16.3 Lesson learnt: The gap in the response to the remote hilly area and the disaster being of unprecedented requires strengthening of the National Emergent Reserve and placing it at similar vulnerable areas for", "prompt relief. Besides there is an urgent need to strengthen the communication system i.e. multi modal system and create an awareness among people about the cloud burst and its consequences.

Box 6.3: Recovery an Opportunity Disaster can become a development opportunity if relief efforts do not merely restore the poor status quo ante, but rather put people on a path of sustainable development. The goal in the transition phase must be to avoid a \u2018circularity of risk\u2019. This is what can happen when houses built with valuable international assistance get washed away during floods, dams left unrepaired after an earthquake aggravate drought conditions, and procedural delays in receiving rehabilitation packages from government and donor agencies leave the poor more vulnerable to the next disaster. (Source: From Relief to Recovery:", "The Gujarat Experience: UNDP) 6.17.2 The Team of Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) visited the place immediately with radiation detection equipments and monitored the radiation levels at various positions near the scrap shop. They found that the particular shop as well as a couple of nearby shops had very high radiation fields. Next day, teams of Radiation Safety Experts from BARC, AERB & Narora Atomic Power Station were sent to Delhi with a wide range of radiation monitoring, detecting equipments and a lead flask to locate, identify, recover, safely secure and dispose radioactive sources. 6.17.3 The response team identified the radiation source as Cobalt-60, used mainly in industry for radiography and in teletherapy for cancer treatment. During the search operation,", "the team could locate, recover and secure eight sources of different intensities. These sources were placed in the lead shielded flask brought from Narora and sent for further examination and safe disposal. Subsequently the area was cleared for the public. A radiation survey of scrap metal shops in neighboring areas was carried out following the incident. It indicated elevated radiation levels in one more scrap shop about 500 m away from the ones where radiation sources were found Recovery Reconstruction and Rehabilitation earlier. A joint team consisting of AERB and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) recovered two more radioactive sources from this shop. Both the sources were safely transferred to a shielding flask and transported back to Narora. 6.17.4 As", "a follow up to this incident, four joint teams of BARC, AERB and NDRF were formed and the surroundings of all remaining 800 shops in the market were scanned when the shops were closed on 14th April, 2010. The entire area was found to be free of elevated radiation fields except at the entrance of the market where the soil over a small patch was slightly contaminated. The contaminated soil showed Cobalt-60 contamination but of very low order. Subsequently, the contaminated soil up to a depth of few centimetres was removed to bring down the radiation 6.17.5 Constitution of a Working Group: In the backdrop of the discovery of radiation sources from the scrap in Mayapuri in New Delhi and", "also to minimise the possibility of such recurrences in future, NDMA constituted a working group headed by Shri B. Bhattacharjee, Member, NDMA to spell out the roles and responsibilities of various agencies in dealing with Radiological Emergencies.

It is anticipated that the experiences mentioned would help the stakeholders in planning effective, efficient and time bound action plan in the event of disasters. Disaster Management in India Effective disaster management requires trained manpower to deal with complex situations effectively and speedily to reduce the impact of disaster on human life and property. It is necessary to continuously undertake measures to build capacity amongst those who are handling disaster prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, reconstruction and also creating awareness amongst people. Therefore, capacity building needs to encompass all resources available within a community, society and organisation to reduce the level of risk or the effects", "of a disaster. UNDP describes \u2018capacity building\u2019 as the creation of an enabling environment with appropriate policy and legal frameworks, institutional development, including community participation (of women in particular), human resource development and strengthening of managerial systems. It adds that capacity building is a long-term, continuing process, in which all stakeholders participate (ministries, local authorities, non-governmental organisations and water user association\u2019s professional associations, academics and others). Capacity may include physical, institutional, social or economic means as well as skilled personal or collective attributes such as leadership and management. Capacity may also be described as capability. 7.2.1 Capacity building31 is much more than training and includes the following: Human resource development, the process of equipping individuals with the understanding, skills and", "access to information, knowledge and training that enables them to perform Organisational development, the elaboration of management structures, processes and procedures, not only within organisations but also the management of relationships between the different organisations and sectors (public, private and community), Institutional and legal framework development, making legal and regulatory changes to enable organisations, institutions and agencies at all levels and in all sectors to enhance their capacities. 7.2.2 Following are considered as vital components of the capacity development: (i) Training: It is a learning process that involves the acquisition of knowledge, sharpening of skills, concepts, rules, or change of attitude and behavior to enhance the performance of individuals associated with different departments and institutions. (ii) Education: Amidst changes of", "the past decades, school education sector, the most discussed topic of national importance, is planning for more contextual, practical and application oriented curriculum for students at different levels of schooling. (iii) Research: Research is an organised and systematic way of finding answers to questions. Systematic because there are certain things in the research process which are always done in order to get most accurate result. (iv) Awareness: Awareness is generally defined as knowledge created through interaction between an agent and its environment. It cannot be simply referred to as \u201cknowing what is going on.\u201d This concept of awareness involves state of knowledge as well as dynamic processes of perception and action. Disaster Management in India 7.3.1 The National Policy on", "Disaster Management (NPDM) describes its approach to capacity development. A strategic approach to capacity development can be addressed effectively only with the active and enthusiastic participation of the stakeholders. This process comprises of awareness generation, education, training, research and development (R&D) etc. It further addresses to put in place an appropriate institutional framework, management systems and allocation of resources for efficient prevention and handling of disasters. The approach to capacity development includes- \u2022 According priority to training for developing community based DM systems for their specific needs in view of the regional diversities and multi-hazard vulnerabilities, \u2022 Conceptualisation of community based DM systems at the national level through a consultative process involving the States and other stakeholders with the state", "and local level authorities in charge of implementation, \u2022 Identification of knowledge-based institutions with proven performance, \u2022 Promotion of International and Regional cooperation, \u2022 Adoption of traditional and global best practices and technologies, \u2022 Laying emphasis on table-top exercises, simulations, mock drills and development of skills to \u2022 Capacity analysis of different disaster responder groups at State, District, and local levels. 7.3.2 NPDM has further elaborated on national priorities, institutional capacity development, training of communities, professional technical education, DM education in schools, training of artisans, training of other groups and licensing and certification. Besides NPDM guidelines issued by NDMA also lay emphasis on capacity development. 7.3.3 Capacity development in India: A realistic National Capacity Development Programme, commensurate with the intensity", "and extent of the hazard in India needs to be evolved and implemented, keeping in view the available resources. This programme of resource enhancement should encompass all institutions,organizations and individuals that have a role in any part of the disaster management cycle. 7.3.4 Capacity gaps in disaster management : To mitigate the impact of disasters, there is a need to work collectively through multidimensional channels combining the efforts, resources and expertise of the government, non- governmental organisations and civil societies. Managing such incidents holistically is a highly specialised and skilled job which cannot be approached in an ad hoc manner. Disaster Management comprises of multi sectoral issues and accordingly calls for all sectors that play pivotal role in managing exigencies", "to develop their human resource capacity accordingly. There seems to exist a wide gap in the knowledge, skill, and attitude of the disaster managers for efficiently managing emergency situations particularly at local and state level where according to one study made by NIDM, Capacity-Risk ratio is remarkably low. To bridge this gap, it is important to have specific capacity development plans and strategies. 7.3.5 Target group: In the field of capacity development, priority is to be given to training of DM officials, functionaries, trainers and elected representatives and community representatives. Due importance requires to be given to DM training and orientation of professionals like doctors, engineers and architects apart from those engaged in response and relief. DM training further Capacity", "Development requires to be included in curricula of educational institutions at all levels of schooling and should include practical instructions as well. 7.3.6 Realizing the importance of Capacity Development of stakeholders in Disaster Management, NIDM has been given the task of preparing National Human Resource and Capacity Development plan, which is at the advanced stage of its formulation. The first draft has been prepared and presented before the MHA. NIDM is finalizing the plan after holding the discussion with MHA on its first draft.

UNDMT and NDMA have constituted a working group to undertake some pilot joint initiatives on various aspects of DM. 9.6 United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) 9.6.1 The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team is a stand-by team of disaster management professionals which are nominated and funded by member International Cooperation governments, OCHA, UNDP and", "operational humanitarian United Nations Agencies such as World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization (WHO). UNDAC is designed to assist the United Nations and governments of a disaster-affected country in meeting international needs for early and qualified information during the first phase of a sudden-onset of emergency as well as in the coordination of incoming international relief at the national level and/or at the site of the emergency. 9.6.2 The UNDAC Team is a United Nations Team of multi-national personnel trained in disaster management for rapid assessment of priority needs and on-site coordination of international assistance. The team members are international disaster/emergency managers from all parts of the world. Under the UNDAC System, whenever", "a major disaster strikes a country and international assistance is warranted, the Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) deputes a team of experts trained in the UNDAC system to carry out an assessment of the requirements for assistance as well as coordinating such assistance with the host country. UN OCHA have empanelled and trained officers worldwide including officers from India. Upon request of a disaster-stricken country, the UNDAC team can be deployed within hours to carry out rapid assessment of priority needs and to support national authorities and the United Nations Resident Coordinator to coordinate international relief on-site. 9.6.3 Officers trained under the UNDAC system ( who have attended the UNDAC Induction and Refresher courses) are on contract", "with the UNDAC for a period of two years (a token amount of 1 USD per year is given to the Officer) after some documentary formalities. After the expiry of the contract, it has to be renewed. Such officers are known as Active members in the UN OCHA parlance and they are liable to be requisitioned for disaster assessment by the UN OCHA in any disaster affected country. 9.6.4 The Government of India have joined the membership of United Nations Disaster Assessment & Coordination (UNDAC) system and has paid, an amount of US$ 50,000 (Fifty thousand) in 2001, with UNOCHA the implementing body of UNDAC programmes. 9.7 United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) 9.7.1 The United", "Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) is a United Nations body formed in December 1991 by the General Assembly resolution 46/182. The resolution was designed to strengthen the response of UNO to complex emergencies and natural disasters by creating the Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), and replacing the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator, which had been formed in 1972. The OCHA was therefore the result of a 1998 reorganization of the DHA and was designed to be the UN focal point on major disasters. Its mandate was also expanded to include the coordination of humanitarian response, policy development and humanitarian advocacy. OCHA is thus an inter- agency body, serving UN agencies and NGOs in", "the humanitarian domain. Its main product is the Consolidated Appeals Process, an advocacy and planning tool to deliver humanitarian assistance together in a given emergency. 9.7.2 OCHA is headed by the Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. OCHA has 1,064 staff located across the world. Major OCHA country offices are located in Afghanistan, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Palestinian territories, Sri Lanka and Sudan (including a sub-office in Southern Sudan\u2019s capital Juba), while regional offices are located in Panama City, Disaster Management in India Dakar, Cairo, Johannesburg, and Bangkok.

The regional groups meet annually to exchange information and experiences acquired in previous relief operations, plan SAR training and discuss methodology for cooperation among SAR teams. It makes recommendations to the Steering Group for further improvement of international cooperation and coordination in disaster response. 9.8.4 Working Groups: INSARAG creates regional and international working groups on an \u201cas required\u201d basis to develop solutions to problems that were identified in regional meetings. The working groups discontinue after delivering the requested result. All member countries and organizations are encouraged to participate in INSARAG Working Groups. 9.8.5", "INSARAG Membership: INSARAG is a network of stakeholders of international earthquake response. Any country or organization with international urban search and rescue response capacity or countries that are prone to earthquakes may join the network. India is a member of INSARAG Asia Pacific Regional Group and has been participating in the INSARAG meetings at international and regional levels. Instructors from India participate in the mock exercises organized by the INSARAG. 9.8.6 India was the Chairman of INSARAG Asia Pacific Regional Group in 2005-06 and organized the meeting as well as the UNDAC Refresher Course during this period of the chairmanship. The INSARAG Guidelines provide guidance for the preparation and deployment of search and rescue (SAR) teams for international disaster response", "operations to earthquake-prone countries as well as checklists for the minimum requirements of USAR teams envisaged for international response operations. The INSARAG Guidelines define coordination and cooperation procedures for international and national responders in major disasters. The following phases are covered: \u2022 Reassignment/stand-down \u2022 Return to home base. International Cooperation In addition, the guidelines focus on topics of particular concern to any organisation that are deployed to international emergency response operations. These include background information about the international humanitarian environment and an explanation of the role of the United Nations system (i.e. OCHA and other UN Humanitarian Agencies) as well as the concept for the On-Site Operations Coordination Centre (OSOCC). 9.8.7 USAR Exercises: Each year, INSARAG organises regional USAR simulation-exercises", "and awareness training courses. These events provide a platform to introduce and practice disaster response coordination methodology as defined in the INSARAG Guidelines. The exercises and courses are typically hosted by earthquake-prone countries. The target audiences are national disaster managers, the UNDAC team, IHP Support Modules as well as domestic disaster response teams and international USAR teams. The recent INSARAG Asia-Pacific Earthquake Response Exercise was held in Agra, India from 3-6 May, 2011. 9.9 Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction (GFDRR) 9.9.1 GFDRR was set up in September 2006 jointly by the World Bank, donor partners (21 countries and four international organisations), and key stakeholders of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UN-ISDR).

Third Trilateral Meeting of Experts of India- Russia and China 9.21.1 As a follow up of the India-Russia-China (IRC) Foreign Ministers meeting held in Yekaterinburg (Russia) in May 2008, two trilateral meetings of experts of IRC were held at Samara, Russia (July, 2008) and at Sanya, China (November, 2009) respectively. The 3rd Trilateral Meeting of Experts of IRC was hosted by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India on 12th and 13th November 2010 at New Delhi. 9.20.2 An action plan for implementation for future trilateral cooperation between India, Russia and China as", "agreed includes: \uf0a7 Visit of experts on geo-spatial technologies in the field of flood and drought \uf0a7 Risk assessment and risk mapping of disasters \u2022 Sharing of experiences in dealing with major emergencies \u2022 Training and capacity development of disaster management. The next trilateral meeting is agreed to be held in St. Petersburg, Russia in August September 9.22. Asian Minister Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (AMCDRR) 9.22.1 Following the World Conference on Disaster Reduction in 2005, several initiatives were undertaken to strengthen the ISDR system to be able to better respond to current disaster trends and the increased expectations and demands by nations and communities for supporting implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 (HFA). International Cooperation 9.22.2 This", "has resulted in increased political commitment and financing of disaster reduction, including development sectors. At the global level more coherence and better coordination amongst ISDR system partners has been achieved through joint work planning and prioritized deliverables. A common approach to work programming in the ISDR system was developed during the 2006-2007 biennium in the context of the former Inter-Agency Task Force on Disaster Reduction and presented to the first session of the Global Platform. 9.22.3 Those consultations gave rise to an ISDR system joint planning framework for country, regional and global levels based on the priorities for action of the Hyogo Framework. To monitor and share the country\u2019s progress at a regional platform, AMCDRR was conceptualized. Since then four", "such conferences were held to enhance and promote regional cooperation for seamless implementation of HFA. The 1st AMCDRR was held in China in August 2005 known as Beijing resolution with the strategic objective of enhancing regional cooperation in the implementation of HFA in Asian region and disaster management cooperation between governments. The 2nd AMCDRR was hosted by India in November 2007 at New Delhi with the strategic objective of construction of joint response system through cooperation among each governments, regional cooperative bodies UN and international organizations. The 3rd AMCDRR was held in December 2008- known at Kaulalampur, Malasiya, which focused on cooperative system through \u201cmutual assistance with private sector\u201d between various parties concerned in the Asian and Pacific region. d.", "The 4th AMCDRR was held at Inchon, South Korea during October 2010 known as Incheon declaration focused on three main themes as mentioned below: \uf0a7 Raising awareness and building capacity for DRR & CCA \uf0a7 Developing and Sharing information, technology, sound practices and lessons learned in climate and disaster risk management. \uf0a7 Promoting integration of DRR & CCA into development for green growth. 9.23. Conclusion This chapter has attempted to capture the various international cooperation initiatives. While India does not seek assistance during the relief and response phases, it welcomes sharing of expertise and also technical assistance based on various international developments. As a signatory to the Hyogo Framework of Action, India is also committed to achieve the priorities and", "the objectives through systematic and institutional efforts. Disaster Management in India10 In the last decade there has been a paradigm shift in Disaster Management in India, a distinct move from the earlier approach of post disaster relief to pre-disaster preparedness, mitigation and risk reduction. The 10th Five Year Plan document emphasised that \u201cwhile hazards, both natural or otherwise, are inevitable, the disasters that follow need not be so and the society can be prepared to cope with them effectively whenever they occur\u201d and called for a \u201cmulti-pronged strategy for total risk management, comprising prevention, preparedness, response and recovery, on the one hand, and for initiating development efforts aimed towards risk reduction and mitigation, on the other\u201d. It is stated that", "only then we can look forward to \u201csustainable development.\u201d The country is also committed to mainstream disaster risk reduction into the process of development planning at all levels for sustainable development, as stated in Hyogo Framework of Action 2005-15: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters. 10.2 Recent Initiatives The 11th five year plan document of Government of India gave impetus to mainstreaming disaster risk reduction as one of the priority programmes in the development planning process and disaster management. \u201cBuilding Back Better\u201d has become the underlining principle in any post disaster reconstruction and rehabilitation programme implemented by Government of India. As mentioned in the report of the working group on Disaster Management for the 11th plan and", "also in the various initiatives towards this effort, the way forward can be divided in the following major areas \u2013 \u2022 Policy guidelines at the macro level that would inform and guide the preparation and implementation of disaster management and development plans across sectors, \u2022 Building in a culture of preparedness and mitigation, \u2022 Operational guidelines of integrating disaster management practices into development, and specific developmental schemes for prevention and mitigation of disasters, \u2022 Having robust early warning systems coupled with effective response plans at district, state and national levels. \u2022 Building capacity of all stakeholders, \u2022 Involving the community, NGOs, CSOs and the media at all stages of DM, \u2022 Addressing gender issues in disaster management planning and developing", "a strategy for inclusive approach addressing the disadvantaged sections of the society towards disaster risk \u2022 Addressing climate risk management through adaptation and mitigation. 10.3 Suggested Steps To achieve results in these key identified areas, the following suggested steps should be integral to all stages of DM including developing a culture of prevention by introducing disaster management in school curricula , professional courses and enhancing the capacity of disaster managers by strengthening training facilities for disaster management; creating mass awareness by disseminating knowledge about the hazards and risks and promoting coping capacities of the communities through community based disaster risk management for better preparedness Disaster Management in India and response; fostering social and gender equality in disaster risk reduction by", "planning and focusing on the needs of the disadvantaged sections of the society. The summarised list of actions that needs to be taken is as follows: 10.4 Developing a Centralised Database In collaboration with the Central Statistical Organization (CSO) an integrated Centralised Disaster database requires to be developed. Data collection on standardised format should be the responsibility of the concerned state government. Such database would facilitate researchers and decision makers to undertake range of analyses to better understand the linkages between disaster management and other sectors that would help in taking up informed risk reduction activities as well as to understand the impact of disasters on economy. 10.5 Early Warning Systems and Communication and Connectivity upto the Last Early warning", "systems vary for the different types of disasters. Due to recent unprecedented devastation unleashed by tsunami, often early warning gets linked with tsunami only, masking the importance of early warning against other forms of disasters. Hazard- specific efficient \u2018early warning systems\u2019 is the need of the hour and it has to be put in place permanently, so that useful information flows throughout the year and is easily understood by the local community. There is scope for improvement in flood, cyclone and storm surge warnings. Such projects need further encouragement and newer projects should be accorded high priority. Even with the best of early warning systems, the impact may still be catastrophic if early warning signals are not properly interpreted and", "communities are not educated and trained to respond to the early warning signals in real time. Therefore, the technology to early warning, on the one hand and, community response to early warning to the other are urgently required. This needs to be coupled with the National Emergency Communication Plan to ensure real time dissemination of early warnings and information to the \u2018at risk\u2019 community and the local authorities. 10.6 Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) EOCs in the country could play a critical role in coordinating emergency activities as well as in providing information to various stakeholders. Effective functioning of these EOCs during emergencies continues to be a major challenge. \u201cState of the art\u201d EOCs at state and district levels with access", "to satellite based imageries need to be planned and established. 10.7 Mitigation Plans and Mainstreaming Disaster Management into the Development Planning Process 10.7.1 Three committees constituted by Government of India are working towards preparing the National Response Plan, National Human Resource and Capacity Development Plan and National Mitigation Plan in respective ministries that have been designated as nodal agencies for various disasters. The draft National Response Plan and National Human Resource and Capacity Development Plan are ready. Certain rectifications and modifications are underway before it is presented to the National Executive Committee for its finalisation. 10.7.2 It is expected that National Response Plan will be put in place once it is adopted by Government of India. It will pave the", "way for institutionalising the response plan in three tiers as envisaged in the Disaster Management Act. 10.7.3 Similarly, the Capacity Development Plan, once it is approved and adopted will provide the roadmap for undertaking the capacity building of persons engaged in different facets of disaster management and enhancing the capacities both at the individual and organizational 10.7.4 So far, Ministries of Defence, Mines (Geological Survey of India), Department of Atomic Energy, Department of Agriculture & Cooperation, Railways and Water resources have submitted their mitigation plans which are under examination and finalisation. Once these mitigation plans are approved, the concerned Ministries will undertake the recommended prevention and mitigation measures to address the hazards and risks involved in the core activities of", "their sector. It is the endeavor of the Government to persuade the other ministries to bring their mitigation plans at the draft stage and take it further for its approval and adoption. 10.7.5 Working Group on Disaster Management: Planning Commission, GOI, has constituted a working Group on Disaster Management for providing inputs to the 12th Five year Plan (2012- 2017) vide no. M-12016/03/2011-PAMD. The Terms of Reference (specific to working group) were To recommend measures to streamline existing institutional structure on disaster management in order to avoid multiplicity of structures keeping in view the provision of the Disaster Management Act 2005. To review implementation of disaster management policy towards disaster risk reduction, preparedness and mitigation at Centre and State levels", "and in the private sector. To explore innovative ways and means for applicable of Science & Technology in disaster risk To draw a roadmap and policy framework to encourage public-private partnership and community participation in disaster management. To assess integration of disaster management related concerned to be inbuilt central sector and centrally sponsored schemes/projects. To suggest programmes for capacity building for disaster mitigation at Centre, State and district levels with special reference to rural and urban area. To indentify priority areas and projects along with financial resources to be undertaken through NDMA. Central Ministries and State Govts in integrated manner during the 12th Plan 10.8 Strengthening the Preparedness Phase Some of the illustrative areas and activities that would reduce the", "risk from hazards in the preparedness phase are summarised as follows- 10.8.1 Urban Planning and Zoning: There is a need to enhance the efforts for integrating disaster risk reduction elements in settlement planning and land use zoning to mitigate flood and earthquake risks. This issue had been mentioned repeatedly at different for a by administrators, practitioners and NGOs working in the area of disaster management. Human settlements must be viewed not only from the perspective of their vulnerability, but also from the perspective of the disasters that they create or that they exacerbate. There is an urgent need to examine such settlements being developed by private builders and developers, which could increase flood Disaster Management in India vulnerability in urban", "and rural areas of many states. Planned urban settlements and housing is the need of the day for disaster risk management that leads to sustainable development, particularly in ecologically sensitive regions, high risk locations and high population density pockets. 10.8.2 Building Codes and Enforcement: Building codes are adhered to only in engineered structures and not in the huge majority of houses across rural and urban India. The building codes have to be continually upgraded with the advent of new information and technology. The greatest challenge, however, is in respect to enforcement of the building codes. 10.8.3 Housing Design and Finance: It has been difficult to ensure compliance to disaster resistant technology at individual house level. There is need to find", "alternative ways to encourage and facilitate individual home builders to use disaster-resilient designs, materials and techniques in the construction of their homes. Publicity and audience friendly information emphasising appropriate designs and the cost differences will go a long way in creating awareness among people for their adoption. Some financial incentives or tool may motivate people, particularly poor people or first-time house owners, to incorporate safety features in their houses. 10.8.4 Flood Proofing: This is an approach adopted in parts of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and few other flood prone states of the country for reducing flood vulnerability. Flood proofing involves constructing earthen mounds to raise entire homesteads\u2014the house, the vegetable garden, livestock pen, grain stores, toilets and water wells above the", "flood level. Encouraging such good practices in other flood prone parts of the country, would go a long way to reduce the risk in 10.8.5 Promoting development of new financial tools: There is need to work for development of new financial tools such as catastrophic risk financing, risk insurance, catastrophic bonds, micro- finance etc. Risk transfer and risk insurance mechanisms would be needed for infrastructure, crops and other assets. Making risk insurance mandatory at least in highly hazard prone states in the country needs to be encouraged. Insurance distributes disaster risk among the broader society and makes great sense when risk has been reduced to some acceptable level. 10.8.6 Agriculture and Aquaculture: These projects should be assessed from the perspective", "of the flood hazards. Much of the flooding that affects large rural habitats and agricultural lands is because of reduced drainage as a result of the expansion of agricultural activities into wetland areas that previously served an important drainage function. Mainstreaming disaster risk management such development of agriculture practices should have compensatory drainage factored into agricultural expansion plans. 10.8.7 Roads and Infrastructure: Standards are generally set to protect roads, railways, power and communication infrastructure from being damaged or destroyed by a 10 or 20 or 50 year flood level. Any new infrastructure project should conduct a disaster impact analysis and ensure that construction does not impede water flow and cause deeper or prolonged floods. Designing the roads to the higher", "standards requires factoring of not only the vulnerability of the roads to floods but also their contribution to hazard. 10.8.8 Logging activities: These activities in the hilly areas destabilise slopes, cause landslides and increase mudflow and silting in the nearby rivers. The revenue generated by logging is far lesser than the losses incurred due to the serious problems of landslides, silting and ecological disturbance caused. There should be a plan for afforestation in the logging area before or just after the logging. Box 10.1: Risk Transfer mechanisms-Insurance as a financial tool for Disaster Management For decades, the financing of disasters has relied on a reactive approach consisting of the diversion of funds from the domestic budgets. Such \u201cex post\u201d funding", "approaches are inefficient, often poorly targeted and insufficient. Moreover, they provide no incentive for proactive risk reduction measures such as improved urban planning, higher construction standards, etc. Reactive approaches to risk financing are becoming increasingly unsustainable as vulnerability is increasing and emerging economies grow and accumulate more assets. The funding gaps between available donor resources and post-disaster funding will grow if disaster prone countries do not engage in risk reduction and pre-disaster risk financing. Insurance markets in the majority of developing countries are underdeveloped. Where hazard coverage exists, it is usually limited to major industrial and commercial properties and some wealthier households. For a number of years, efforts are on to promote a more proactive approach to risk financing. A", "number of examples come from World Bank led efforts, including the provisions of technical support to Mexico in issuing a cat bond; contingency financing arrangements in Cambodia, the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facilities (CCRIF - the first regional institution which allows the eighteen participating countries to pool their risk and save on individual premium payments), the Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool (TCIP - a mandatory earthquake insurance pool for homeowners). These initiatives provide much needed, immediate liquidity after a disaster for more effective government response. Micro disaster Insurance: It has great potential, but faces several challenges before it becomes a sustainable mechanism for effective risk management for the poor. The study by ProVention Consortium and the International Institute of Applied System", "Analysis found that micro Insurance holds great potential to protect the poor from disaster shocks. Financial Viability: Disaster Insurance should be based on sound estimates of low-probability, high-consequence risks so that the premium can be priced and the requisite capital reserve or reinsurance can be assured. Where there is a high degree of ambiguity with the risk estimates of extreme events, international donors may need to provide incentives for the private sector involvement in such schemes. Affordability: Micro insurance needs to be affordable to low income-clients. Disaster insurance premiums include the costs of handling many small contracts, distributing the product often to remote areas, as well as assuring sufficient capital to cover dependant claims. There are several ways to reduce", "disaster insurance premiums. The most obvious is subsidies from the public authorities, international donors or those at lower risk in the insurance pool (cross subsidies in insurance systems). The Hungarian government is providing subsidies to poor households as part of a recently legislated flood insurance pool. In the UK, extensive cross subsidies in the private flood insurance systems make it affordable to low income households. In developing countries, transaction costs can be minimised by offering policies to groups or communities through established microfinance institutes. The high costs of capital reserves and reinsurance can be lowered through government or donor provision of reinsurance. An example is the Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool, where the World Bank reinsures a layer of risk for", "the pool.

A review of micro-insurance for natural disaster risks in developing countries, IIASA / ProVention Consortium, 2007 Disaster Management in India 10.8.9 Design and construction of critical infrastructure and lifeline facilities (hospitals/ schools etc): It has been observed in the past disasters that schools and hospitals are badly affected. Therefore, construction of all new schools and hospital needs to be brought under the regime of disaster resistant technology. 10.8.10 Medical Preparedness for recovery of affected person in any kind of disaster is of paramount importance. There exits huge gap between demand and supply of medical care, particularly in the area of trauma care. This needs", "to be strengthened and capacity augmented at every level from primary to referral level. The capacity of doctors and Paramedical staff also needs to be strengthened and to be geared to meet the challenges of post-disaster recovery. 10.9 Capacity Building Plan In addition to development of National Human Resource Plan, a training calendar of Disaster Management institutes and agencies at the international, national and sub-national levels needs to be compiled and publicised so that the stakeholders could avail of the opportunities to build 10.9.1 Concerted efforts are required to work closely with UN agencies, bilateral agencies and NGOs for DRR. Bilateral and Multilateral Cooperation with countries prone to hazard and those having developed expertise in management of different disasters and", "international institutions for DRR would facilitate and encourage participation of professionals and officials in national and international events in enhancing their capacities. 10.9.2 International collaboration in the field of disaster management should be strengthened. The NDMA and NIDM have to play a key role in awareness generation and engage with print, electronic and folk media to carry forward programmes for public awareness. There is also a great need to develop the capacity and sensitise the media to comprehend disaster awareness and reporting, so that it plays a positive role in creating awareness and in handling disaster information and news during emergencies. 10.9.3 In order to address the issue of structural safety against multi-hazards, steps that lead to improvement of construction", "on the ground need to be initiated. This would entail enhancing community awareness, capacity building of architects and masons, strengthening of enforcement, etc. 10.9.4 Inter-state sharing of resources has been very effective in the past. Such sharing should be facilitated by encouraging states to enter into mutual agreements with each other on possible nature and type of resources that can be shared and set up administrative mechanisms for implementing these effectively. 10.10 National, State and District Level Response Plans The recent Japanese earthquake, tsunami, followed by fire and the nuclear energy crisis is a pointer to the fact that despite best preparedness and mitigation and capacity building plans being in place, response and crisis management plans continue to be relevant.", "To put things in place an effective response plans at the National, States, Districts and the Sub-districts level should therefore, be encouraged to strengthen review and update the existing capacity for response and crisis management. 10.11 Corporate Social Responsibility Business entities are expected to shoulder responsibilities for the impact of their activities on the consumers, employees and community as a whole. Efforts are therefore needed to engage corporate bodies in undertaking disaster risk reduction activities as a part of their corporate social responsibilities. NDMA and NIDM have to actively engage with the corporate sector in mainstreaming DRR within their CSR framework. 10.12 Integrating Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction The current trends of climate change are expected to increase the", "frequency and intensity of existing hazards, an increased probability of extreme events, spur the emergence of new hazards and vulnerabilities with differential spatial and socio-economic impacts. This is likely to further degrade the resilience and coping capacities of poor and vulnerable communities, who make up from a quarter to half of the population of most Indian cities Vulnerability has typically contributed more to overall risk in India than hazard exposure. The efforts for integrating climate change and DRR measures needs to be further strengthened and institutionalised and community be sensitised to take up such adaptive measures, which reduces their vulnerability. 10.13 Conclusion The above mentioned initiatives are only an indicative list of actions requiring attention. Every stakeholder involved needs to", "contribute his bit in order to ensure that the increasing hazards and risks and the vulnerabilities get addressed in a planned and systematic manner, thereby increasing the coping capacities of the communities at large and making them resilient to the impacts of disasters. The Government is committed to structure and convert these requirements into actionable format to place them on a roadmap and source the funding for their implementation.

The growing population in areas prone to natural hazards has exposed billions of people to disaster risks. And yet, given the grim scenario of climate change impacts, more disasters are bound to happen if we do not act decisively to reduce such risks. We therefore need to build our resilience to disasters today, as well our resilience to", "climate change in the future, for a much safer environment for people to live in. Amid the calls for better disaster preparedness in our country, I believe we should focus on one key lesson: Disaster prevention starts long before a typhoon makes landfall, before an earthquake happens or before a volcano erupts. Early warning and early action should be at the very heart of our efforts. Through this manual, I strive to help everyone understand the risks we face and equip ourselves with preventive measures to lessen, if not eliminate, the impact of natural hazards. We must also be ready to face these hazards and we must know what to do in order to secure ourselves in case of a", "disaster. I encourage you to read this manual carefully to be able to acquire basic disaster preparedness skills. This is a compilation of materials from the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), Department of Education (DepEd), Department of Health (DOH), Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) and Vigan City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. I urge you to pass on this manual to all those in your community as a way of developing, supporting and strengthening your community-based disaster preparedness plans. Senator, Republic of the Philippines Chairperson, Senate Committee on Climate Change United Nations Regional Champion for Disaster", "Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation for Asia-Pacifi c Disaster Preparedness & First Aid Handbook Table of Contents Disaster Risk Reduction and Management for: Volcanic Eruption Tropical Cyclone Extreme Climatic Variability \u2013 Heat Waves Human-Induced Hazards \u2013 Structure Collapse What to Have During Emergencies WHAT IS AN EARTHQUAKE? An earthquake is a feeble shaking to violent trembling of the ground produced by the sudden displacement of rocks or rock materials below the earth\u2018s surface. Tectonic earthquakes are generated by the sudden displacement along faults in the solid and rigid layer of the earth. Volcanic earthquakes are induced by rising magma beneath active volcanoes. THE PHILIPPINES AS AN EARTHQUAKE- The Philippine Archipelago lies between 2 major tectonic plates, the Philippine Sea", "Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The Philippine Sea Plate is being subducted westward along the Philippine Trench at the eastern side of the Philippines. The Eurasian Plate is being subducted eastward along the Manila Trench, Negros-Sulu Trench and the Cotabato Trench at the western side of the country except in southern Mindoro and western Panay, where collision takes place. Active faults traverse the archipelago, the longest of which is the Philippine Fault Zone. Subduction of plates along the trenches and movements along active faults are responsible for the present-day high seismicity of the Philippines. For the last 400 years, the Philippines has been affected by 90 damaging earthquakes. Hence, the likelihood of destructive earthquakes occurring again in the future is", "indeed very strong. Around 20 earthquakes per day occur in the Philippines, most of which are not felt. About two hundred earthquakes are felt every year. HAZARDS POSED BY EARTHQUAKES 1. GROUND SHAKING The destructive effects of earthquakes are due mainly to intense GROUND SHAKING or vibration. Because of severe ground shaking, low and tall buildings, towers, and posts may tilt, split, topple or collapse; road foundations, railroad tracks and bridges may break; water pipes and other utility installations may get dislocated; dams and similar structures may break and cause flooding; and other forms of mass movement may be generated. LIQUEFACTION is a process where particles of loosely consolidated and water-saturated deposits of fine sand are rearranged into a more", "compact state. Water and sediments are squeezed out towards the surface in the form of water and sand fountaining (sand boiling), thus creating a condition resembling \u2017quick sand\u2018. The consequent loss in volume and underlying support results in subsidence of the ground on top of the liquefying sandy layers and, with it, the sinking and/or tilting of any structures above it. Liquefaction prone areas may be found in beach zones, sand spits, sand bars, tombolos, wide coastal plains, deltaic plains, floodplains, abandoned river meanders, former lake beds, former or existing marshlands and swamplands, and in areas underlain by sandy lahar deposits. Landslides are a downward movement of slope materials either slowly or quickly. A landslide may be a rock fall,", "topple, slump, slide or debris flow. Intense ground shaking can trigger a landslide by loosening the cohesion that bonds the slope materials together, thereby making it easier for gravity to pull it downwards. Hilly and mountainous areas, escarpments, steep river banks, sea cliffs, and other steep slopes are prone to landsliding. The main effect of landsliding is burial. 4. GROUND RUPTURE Many strong earthquakes originate along faults that break the earth\u2018s rigid crust. GROUND RUPTURE is a deformation on the ground that marks the intersection of the fault plane with the earth\u2018s surface. The most common manifestation is a long fissure extending from a few kilometers to tens of kilometers, although ground rupture may also occur as a series of", "discontinuous cracks, mounds, or depressions. The length of ground rupture and the width of the zone of deformation generally increase with the magnitude and type of earthquake. Tsunamis are small to giant sea waves mostly generated by submarine earthquakes. Not all submarine earthquakes, however, can cause tsunamis to occur. Tsunamis can only occur when the earthquake is shallow -seated, and strong enough (about Magnitude 7) to displace parts of the seabed and disturb the mass of water over it. Other causes of tsunamis include submarine or coastal landslides, pyroclastic flows, large volume debris avalanches from submarine and partly submerged volcanoes, and caldera collapse.

The key to effective disaster prevention is planning. \u2022 Determine whether the site is along an active fault and/or prone to liquefaction or landslide which may cause damage to your house or building. \u2022 Be sure that proper structural design and engineering practice is followed when constructing a house or building. \u2022 Evaluate the structural soundness of buildings and important infrastructure; strengthen or retrofit if found necessary. \u2022 Plan ahead with", "your family in case of an earthquake. Decide on a place to meet in the event that you are separated. \u2022 Develop family, workplace and community preparedness and evacuation plans 2. Prepare your place of work and residence for the event. \u2022 Strap heavy furniture/cabinets to the wall to prevent sliding \u2022 Check the stability and secure hanging objects, like ceiling fans and chandeliers, which may break loose and fall during \u2022 Heavy materials, breakable items, harmful chemicals, and flammable materials should be stored in the lowermost shelves and secured firmly. \u2022 Make it a habit to turn gas tanks off when not in use. 3. Familiarize yourself with your place of work and \u2022 Identify relatively strong parts of", "the building like locations near elevator shafts, near columns and beams, and sturdy tables where you can take refuge during an earthquake. \u2022 Learn to use fire extinguishers, first aid kits, alarms, and emergency exits. These should be accessible/conveniently located, and prominently marked. 4. Prepare and maintain an earthquake survival kit consisting of a battery-powered radio, flashlight, first aid kit, potable water, candies, ready-to-eat food, sturdy rope, water- resistant matches, whistle, dust mask, clothes, and blanket. 5. Conduct and participate in regular earthquake drills. 2. If you are inside a structurally sound building, stay there. \u2022 Protect your body from falling debris by staying in stronger parts of the building like near columns and beams, outside the elevator shaft, or", "by getting under a sturdy desk or table. Remember Duck, Cover, and Hold (Duck and Cover under a table, Hold on to the legs). \u2022 Stay away from glass windows, shelves, cabinets and other heavy objects. \u2022 Beware of falling objects. Be alert and keep your eyes 3. If you are outside, move to an open area. \u2022 Get away from power lines, posts, walls and other structures that may fall or collapse. \u2022 Stay away from buildings with glass panes. \u2022 If you are on a mountain or near a steep hill slope, move away from steep escarpments which may be affected by 4. When driving a vehicle, pull to the side of the road and stop. Do not", "attempt to cross bridges or overpasses, which may have been damaged. 5. If you are near the shore and you feel an earthquake strong enough to make standing difficult, it is always safest to assume that a tsunami might be triggered. Move quickly to higher 1. Once the shaking stops, take the fastest and safest way out of the building. Do not rush to the exit. Get out calmly in an orderly manner. Bring your emergency kit. Do not use elevators; use the stairs. Go to an open area or designated evacuation area. Check yourself and others for injuries. 2. Unless you need emergency help: Do not use your telephone to call relatives and friends. Disaster prevention authorities may need", "the line for emergency communication. Do not use your car and drive around areas of damage, as rescue and relief operations need the roads for mobility. 3. Help reduce the number of casualties from the \u2022 Don\u2018t enter partially damaged buildings; strong aftershocks may cause these to collapse. \u2022 Gather information and disaster prevention instructions from battery-operated radios. \u2022 Obey public safety precaution. \u2022 Clean up chemical spills, toxic and flammable materials to avoid any chain of unwanted events. \u2022 Check for fire and, if any, have it controlled. \u2022 Check your water and electrical lines for defects; if any damage is suspected, turn the system off through the main valve or switch. 5. If you must evacuate your residence,", "leave a message stating where you are going. What is a tsunami? A tsunami is a series of small to giant sea waves commonly generated by under-the-sea earthquakes and whose heights may reach more than 5 meters. They are erroneously called tidal waves and are sometimes mistakenly associated with storm surges. Tsunamis can occur when the earth is shallow- seated and strong enough to displace parts of the seabed and disturb the mass of water over it. Locally-generated tsunamis The coastal areas in the Philippines, especially those facing the Pacific Ocean, South China Sea, Sulu Sea, and Celebes Sea, can be affected by tsunamis that may be generated by local earthquakes. In August 17, 1976, a 7.9-magnitude earthquake hit the", "Moro Gulf and produced tsunamis that devastated the southwest coast of Mindanao and left more than 3,000 people dead, with at least 1,000 people missing. More than 8,000 people were injured and approximately 12,000 families were rendered homeless by more than 5-meter high waves. The November 15, 1994 Mindoro Earthquake also generated tsunamis that left 78 casualties. These tsunamis occurred within a very short time, with a first wave reaching the shoreline nearest the epicenter, 2 to 5 minutes after the main earthquake. These tsunamis were both locally-generated. There will not be enough time for warning in case of locally-generated tsunamis. Far-field tsunamis Tsunamis may also be generated from distant locations, such as those coming from other countries bordering the", "Pacific Ocean like Chile, Alaska in the USA, and Japan (far field tsunamis). The tsunami of May 2, 1960 that was generated by a strong earthquake from Chile killed 61 in Hilo, Hawaii, while 20 people were reportedly killed in the Philippines. Travel times for tsunamis generated in distant locations are longer (1 to 24 hours) and will generally give enough time for warning from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) and Northwest Pacific Tsunami Advisory Center (NWPTAC). Natural signs of a local tsunami 1. You would feel the ground or earth shaking changes occur. There is sudden retreat or rise of sea water. 3. Rumbling sound of approaching waves Tsunami Safety and Preparedness \u2022 Do not stay in low-lying", "coastal areas after a strong earth- quake. Move to higher grounds immediately. \u2022 If unusual sea conditions like rapid lowering of the sea level are observed, immediately move toward high ground. \u2022 Never go down to the beach to watch for a tsunami. When you can see the wave, you are too close to escape it. \u2022 During the sudden retreat of sea level, interesting sights are of- ten revealed. Fish may be stranded on dry land thereby attracting peo- ple to collect them. Sandbars and coral flats may also be exposed. These scenes tend to attract peo- ple to flock to the shoreline, thereby increasing the number of people at risk. \u2022 Stay out of danger areas until an", "\u2015all clear\u2016 bulletin is is- sued by a competent authority. A tsunami is not a single wave but a series of waves. VOLCANIC ERUPTION Why does the Philippines have many volcanoes? The Philippines sits on a unique tectonic setting ideal to volcano formation. The archipelago is surrounded by subducting plates, as manifested by the trenches that are related to volcano formation. Classification of volcanoes 1. Active volcanoes \u2022 Erupted within historical times (within the last 600 years). Accounts of these eruptions were documented by man; \u2022 Erupted within the last 10,000 years based on analyses of datable materials. 2. Potentially active volcanoes \u2022 Are morphologically young-looking but with no historical records of eruption. 3.

Always be on alert and listen to advisories of not venturing into identified restricted areas during volcanic unrest. \u2022 Identify, evaluate, and characterize areas vulnerable to hazards and implement appropriate land use plan and \u2022 Heed warnings and evacuation orders", "in times of volcanic What to do before, during and after an ash fall 1. When there is an impending eruption that may cause ashfall, listen to the radio for updates. 2. Prepare a gas mask or clean cloth for covering the nose, candles, matches, flashlights and extra batteries. Put these things in an accessible place. 1. Stay calm. Cover your nose and mouth with a damp, clean cloth or gas mask. 2. Listen to the radio for updates or developments regarding the volcanic eruption. 3. Keep your pets in their shelter or inside the house to keep them from inhaling ash. 4. Close all windows and doors of your house. 5. If you are driving a vehicle, pull to", "the side of the road and stop if there is heavy ashfall. 6. If you are outdoors, look for shelter and wear glasses to protect your eyes. Avoid using contact lenses. 1. As soon as the ashfall tapers, scrape off the ashfall that has accumulated on rooftops to prevent the collapse of houses. After removing the ash, clean the roof and gutter with water. 2. Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly before 3. Use a vacuum cleaner or shake ash loose from the furniture before dusting them. Cover your nose and mouth while cleaning. 4. To remove ash from glass windows and doors, use a water hose before washing them with soap and 5. Shake loose ash from plants before", "watering them. 6. Use powder detergent in washing clothes contaminated 7. Collect the ashes and put them in an area far from water drainage to avoid clogging. TROPICAL CYCLONE Atropical cyclone or \u2015bagyo\u2016 is an intense low- pressure system with minimum sustained winds of 35 kilometers per hour (kph). A yearly average of 20 tropical cyclones enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) and 90% of these affect the country. Hazards due to tropical cyclones are strong winds with heavy rainfall that can cause widespread flooding/flashfloods, storm surges, landslides and mudflows.

Floods can cause severe damages to lives and properties. Flood/Flooding/Inundation \u2013 is a great flow of water that rises and spreads over the land when a volume of water from lakes/streams/rivers exceeds its carrying capacity and escapes from its usual boundaries. Flooding can be classified based on the following criteria: \u2022 Based on location or place of occurrence River flooding is caused by the overflowing of the river when run-off exceeds the capacity of the channels and", "flooding the adjacent low-lying areas called the floodplain. This may last a few hours or many days depending on the intensity, amount and the distribution of the rainfall. - Coastal flooding may occur due to storm surges, high tide and tsunamis (waves produced by earthquakes/volcanoes at sea). Storm surge occurs when strong onshore winds push the water inland and cause a rise in sea level, and flooding the low- lying coastal areas. Worst cases could occur when it coincides with the occurrence of high tide. - Urban flooding occurs in an area where roads are usually paved.

Sheet flooding may also result when water from a river channel with insufficient carrying capacity over-tops its bank, inundating the adjacent areas. Causes of Flooding Floods are due to the complex", "combination of weather, climatic and human activities: 1. Heavy, continuous rain that does not cease, or ceases only briefly. 2.

The highest water level rise or the peak of a storm surge usually happens on thesame time there is a passage of a typhoon across a coastline. The wall of water can engulf low-lying coastal communities and can also bring destruction to natural and man-made structures, especially if this coincides with the occurrence of high tide. The stronger the", "tropical cyclone, the lower the atmospheric pressure; the shallower the coast, the higher the surge will be.

The typical thunderstorm is 5 kilometers in diameter and lasts an average of 30 minutes, but the more severe ones may last much longer. When compared with tropical cyclones, thunderstorms affect relatively small areas but all thunderstorms are dangerous.

Lightning can cause death and injuries and can 2. Heavy Rainfall Excessive rains can produce flashfloods/floods that can transform small creeks into raging floodwaters, sweeping over structures along their path. 3. Tornado/Waterspout The more severe hazard brought about by a thunderstorm is a tornado/waterspout. The amount of destruction depends largely on the strength of the wind. Most injuries and deaths result from flying thunderstorm cloud. Since the air temperature in the country is normally high, hailstones that reach the ground are usually the size of a grain of corn, which is seldom of sufficient size to cause damage to", "properties. However, hail can destroy crops.

People who are outdoors (especially under or near tall trees, in isolated sheds or near hilltops) are at risk from lightning. Also in danger are people in automobiles when flash flooding occurs near them. How to prevent damages due to lightning \u2022 If you are outdoors, seek shelter from lightning.

ATORNADO is described as a violently rotating column of air extending from a thunderstorm to the ground. Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris. A tornado acts like a giant vacuum cleaner, sucking and carrying objects\u2014such as trees, structures, or debris\u2014aloft on its path and jumping across the ground in a narrow erratic movement. It can strike any time of the day but does so more frequently in the afternoon\u2014when the temperature is at its highest\u2014and in the evening. It may also develop when there are tropical Much of the damage comes from its", "extreme winds. Wind speeds are estimated to exceed 450 km/hr and may last for a few minutes. Whenever a tornado strikes, it may leave marks of destruction. Tornadoes are often obscured by rain or dust. There have been reported occurrences of \u2015buhawi,\u2016 the local term for tornado, in the Philippines. One occurred in San Miguel, Bulacan, and damaged at least 30 houses in 2007. Signs of an impending tornado \u2022 A funnel-shaped column appears from the base of a cumu- \u2022 The weather feels warm, humid, uncomfortable and calm. \u2022 Lightning flashes and thunder cracks. \u2022 A tornado reaching the ground produces a roaring or What is a waterspout? A tornado that occurs or moves over a body of water", "is called a waterspout. On the average, a waterspout is less intense and less violent, but the larger ones can completely destroy a small sea craft. Cases of waterspout coming ashore with the intensity of a tornado have been reported. In December 1979, one struck Gingoog City in Misamis Oriental, and rendered 10,000 families homeless.

They come and go quickly. There may not be time for a warning. \u2022 Be alert for the sudden appearance of violent winds, rain, hail or a funnel-shaped cloud in your locality. ALANDSLIDE is the downward and outward movement of slope materials composed of rocks and/or soil. This event is generally triggered by prolonged heavy rainfall or by earthquakes. A number of factors contribute", "to the occurrence of landslides. These include the high degree of weathering and fracturing of rocks, steep configuration of slope, deforestation, and the overloading of slope surfaces following the construction of heavy structures.

What to do during: \u2022 Evacuate the community immediately if warned of an im- pending landslide \u2022 Get out of the house/building as soon as possible when rumbling sounds are heard from upstream or when trembling of the ground is felt. Run across a slope, not downwards. \u2022 Stay away from the path of landslide debris, or seek refuge behind a sturdy tree or structure. What to do after: \u2022 Ask proper authorities to thoroughly examine damaged structures and utilities before using these. \u2022 Stay away from the landslide area. There may be danger of additional landslides. \u2022 Check with caution injured and trapped persons within the landslide area.

These rising temperatures will cause changes in weather patterns that may result to increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods affecting the most vulnerable areas of the country and the whole region as well. Longer drought periods and more intense rainfall will greatly affect water resources. Other impacts include an increasing number of intense tropical cyclones, storm surges, killer heat waves", "and the emergence of more weather-related diseases, massive species extinction, ecosystem collapse, agricultural failure due to changes in rainfall patterns, higher temperature and saltwater intrusion, and rising sea levels which will eventually inundate coastal towns and cities around the world. Periodical Phenomenon of Climatic Variability An extreme climate event associated with the El Ni\u0148o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences the climate variability of the country. It is a global phenomenon that occurs in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, affecting the normal rainfall pattern of the different regions of the world, but impacts differ. ENSO has two phases: the warm phase referred to as El Ni\u0148o and the cold phase referred to as La Ni\u0148a. La Ni\u0148a is characterized by unusually cold surface", "ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, as compared to El Ni\u0148o, which is characterized by unusually warm surface ocean temperatures. The system may be described generally by an irregular cycle of alternating periods of warm (El Ni\u0148o) and cold (La Ni\u0148a) conditions, with a transition period (Neutral condition) between them. El Ni\u0148o and La Ni\u0148a occur on average of every 3 to 5 years. Generally, the impact of El Ni\u0148o in the country is drier than normal rainfall condition, which sometimes leads to drought, and La Ni\u0148a to be associated with wetter than normal condition, causing devastating floods and landslides. Heat Waves occur when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature", "by 5-degree Celcius, the normal period being 1961\u20131990 (World Meteorological Organization). Heat can kill by pushing the human body temperature beyond its limits. Elderly people, young children, and those who are sick or overweight are more likely to become victims of extreme heat. Men sweat more than women so they are more susceptible to heat illness and become more quickly dehydrated. Excessive heat that lasts for more than two days significantly increases heat-related illnesses. People living in urban areas may be at greater risk from the effects of a prolonged heat wave than people living in rural regions. What to do before: \u2022 Plan changes in your daily activities to avoid strenuous work during the warmest part of the day.", "\u2022 Consult a physician when affected by extreme heat. \u2022 Undergo training on first aid. \u2022 Interview local physicians and paramedics about the dan- gers of sunburn, heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and other pos-sible conditions caused by excessive heat. What to do during: \u2022 Wear loose-fitting, lightweight, light-colored clothing that will cover as much skin as possible. \u2022 Protect your face and head by wearing a wide-brimmed \u2022 Drink plenty of water even if you do not feel thirsty to pre- vent dehydration. \u2022 Avoid drinks with alcohol or caffeine, which can also cause \u2022 Take frequent breaks if you must work outdoors. \u2022 Use a buddy system when working in extreme heat. \u2022 Eat frequent small meals for easy", "digestion. \u2022 Use salt tablets or table salt because it retains fluids.

Fire is composed of three elements\u2014heat, fuel, and oxygen, which when combined, will result in a chemical reaction called burning. The leading cause of death in a fire, by a three-to-one ratio over burns, is asphyxiation (choking sen- sation). Inhaling carbon monoxide can cause loss of con- sciousness or death within minutes. The heat from a hostile fire exceeds anything to which a person is normally exposed. A fully developed room fire has temperatures over 1, 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

To maintain life, we need our hearts to pump oxygenated blood to our vital organs. To achieve this we need to be breathing and our hearts need to be pumping. Should either of these functions stop, our brain and other vital organs will start to deteriorate (brain cells usually die within 3-4 minutes due to lack of oxygen) which will eventually lead to death. \u2018Ventricular fibrillation\u2019 is the most common result of cardiac arrest, caused by", "heart attack.

If the airway is not clear, the breath you give will not fill their lungs. Do not give the casualty more than two rescue breaths before continuing with chest compressions. If you have someone with you, take it in turns to administer chest compressions. Every 1-2 minutes, change over so one person administers chest compressions while the other gives the rescue breaths. Ensure there is as", "little delay in swapping as possible, so the casualty is constantly receiving CPR. Continue CPR until: The emergency services arrive to take over. You become too fatigued to continue. Resuscitation for babies and children: Understandably, some people are reluctant to perform CPR on a child or baby for fear of causing further harm to them. However, a child in this state is likely to suffer far worse consequences if CPR is not administered. Please keep that in mind should the situation ever arise. CPR on a child is very similar to CPR on an adult. There are only a few minor modifications to the process, which are detailed below: \uf0b7 Give the child 5 rescue breaths before starting CPR, then", "switch back to 30 chest compressions to 2 rescue breaths. \uf0b7 If you are alone, perform CPR for about a minute before going for help. Chest compressions on a child should be about one-third of the depth of the chest. For a baby under 1 year old, only use two fingers to administer CPR. For a child over 1 year use either one or two hands to compress the chest, again one third of the depth of the chest. Full details on child CPR is covered later in the notes. Resuscitation with chest compressions only An adult cardiac arrest casualty will probably still have oxygen in their blood stream. If there is any reason you cannot give the casualty rescue", "breaths, you can still help the casualty by giving them \u2018chest compression only\u2019 resuscitation.

If you are only giving chest compressions, the continuous rate should be 100- 120 compressions per minute. If you have someone with you, take it in turns to administer chest compressions. Every 1-2 minutes, change over so one person administers chest compressions while the other rests and maintains the casualty\u2019s airway. Ensure there is as little delay in swapping as possible, so the casualty is constantly receiving chest Vomiting during CPR: It is not uncommon for an unconscious casualty who has stopped", "breathing to vomit.

Points of hygiene during resuscitation: \uf0b7 Use a cloth, or whatever you have to hand to wipe the casualty\u2019s mouth clean. \uf0b7 Face shields are useful to have on you, as they protect you from any serious infections such as TB, Hepatitis, etc. Always use one if you have it with you.", "\uf0b7 If you do not have a face shield to hand, a piece of plastic with a hole cut or torn into it will suffice, as will a handkerchief or any piece of material which will help to prevent direct contact. \uf0b7 If you are in any doubt about the safety of giving rescue breaths, you can perform \u2018chest compression only\u2019 resuscitation as a last means (this is described above). \uf0b7 If you have protective gloves, use these. Always wash your hands afterwards to prevent any contamination. Main causes of unconsciousness in a casualty: Unconsciousness is an interruption to normal brain activity.

Abdomen and pelvis \uf0b7 Press the abdomen gently with the palm of", "your hand to see if there are any irregularities or pain response. \uf0b7 Gently put pressure on the pelvis to check for any fractures. \uf0b7 Check if the casualty is bleeding or is incontinent. \uf0b7 Run your hands down the legs gently, checking for any fractures or breaks. \uf0b7 Repeat the action with the arms. \uf0b7 Check the casualty for any clues to their condition (medic alert jewellery, needle marks, smell of alcohol, etc.). Check the pockets \uf0b7 Check there is nothing in the pockets that will injure the casualty further when you roll them into the recovery position. \uf0b7 Try to have a witness present if you need to remove any items from the casualty who can vouch for", "you. \uf0b7 Be wary, there may be sharp objects in the casualty\u2019s pockets such as needles \uf0b7 Be sure to loosen any restrictive clothing, such as ties and belts. \uf0b7 Gently place the casualty in the recovery position (see page 12). \uf0b7 If you have any suspicion that the casualty may have an injured neck, try to get someone to hold the head in line with the body while you turn the casualty (see spinal injuries, page 55) to lessen the risk of further damage. \uf0b7 Be careful not to cause further injury to the casualty or exacerbate suspected Mechanics of injury Before attempting to move a casualty, it is important to think about the \u2018mechanics of injury\u2019. This is", "the process of figuring out what has happened, and what injuries are likely to have been sustained by the casualty. If you suspect there is a neck injury involved, you must try to get someone to help you by keeping the casualty\u2019s head in line with their body at all times, even when the casualty is lying still. Any movement can cause serious, irreparable damage. See page 55 for how to do this, under treatment of spinal injury. The recovery position When an unconscious casualty is lying on their back, their breathing can be hampered by them \u2018swallowing their tongue\u2019 (the tongue slides back in their throat, cutting off the airway). Or, the person can vomit while unconscious, and are", "not able to reflexively heave or expel the vomit, which can suffocate them. By placing the casualty on their side (the recovery position), this ensures the airway is clear by stopping the tongue sliding back in the throat and allowing vomit to drain from the mouth. Try, if possible, to move the casualty onto their left, as this will keep any contents in the stomach from escaping. However, always place breathing first, so if a casualty has any damage to their right lung for example, place them on their right to protect the one working lung. \uf0b7 Remove any dangers from the casualty (remove glasses, check pockets for anything that will cause further injury) and straighten the legs. \uf0b7 Preferably", "move the left arm out, with their elbow bent and palm face up. \uf0b7 Now bring the far side leg into a bent position, with the foot on the floor, tuck their foot under the near side leg to keep it up. \uf0b7 Bring the far side arm across the chest, with the back of the hand against the casualty\u2019s cheek, and hold it there. \uf0b7 Now using the bent knee as leverage and holding the back of the hand against the cheek, pull the knee towards you, rolling the casualty onto their side. Make sure their knee is touching the ground so that they don\u2019t roll back. \uf0b7 Make sure that the upper leg is bent at both the", "hip and the knee, as though the casualty is in a \u2018running\u2019 position. Keep their hand under their cheek and tilt their head back to clear the airway. \uf0b7 Check the casualty\u2019s back for any hidden injuries, and if you have anything to hand, cover them for warmth and their dignity. \uf0b7 Call 999 and request an ambulance. \uf0b7 Monitor the casualty\u2019s breathing every 30 seconds while awaiting the ambulance. If the casualty stops breathing, return them to their backs and Things not to do: \uf0b7 Never put anything into an unconscious casualty\u2019s mouth. \uf0b7 Never move a casualty without performing the checks mentioned first. \uf0b7 Never place anything under the head of a casualty who is on their back.", "This could obstruct the airway. \uf0b7 Never unnecessarily move a casualty as this could cause further injury. Treat any suspected head injury with the utmost caution, as they have the potential to be very serious. Head injuries often lead to unconsciousness and all the attendant problems. Also, head injuries can cause permanent damage to the Head injuries may also be associated with neck and spinal injuries, so they must be treated with the utmost caution (see spinal injuries, page 55). The three main areas of concern with head injuries are concussion, compression and a fractured skull. Concussion occurs when the brain is violently shaken. Our brains are cushioned within our skulls by \u2018cerebro-spinal fluid\u2019 (CSF), so any blow to the", "head can cause the brain to bang against the skull which disrupts its usual functions. A casualty may pass out briefly (no more than 2-3 minutes), and when they come round their level of response should return to normal. Concussion casualties should return to normal if no complications arise. However, a concussed casualty should not be left on their own and should ideally be monitored for 24 hours. No sporting activity should be undertaken for at least three weeks after a concussion. Compression injuries are very serious, as the brain is under extreme pressure which is caused by bleeding or swelling in the cranial cavity. Compression can arise from a skull fracture or head injury, but can also be brought", "on by illness (type of stroke, brain tumour, meningitis, etc.). Fractures to the skull are very serious as the broken bone of the skull can cause direct damage to the brain which can cause bleeding and therefore compression. Treat any casualty who has had a head injury, and whose response level is low, as having a fractured skull. Possible signs and symptoms of head injury Casualty is unconscious for short period, after which response levels are back to normal, recovery is usually Possible history of recent head trauma with recovery, followed by Casualty may suffer from concussion or compression also, so symptoms of these may be present. Short term memory loss, groggy, confused irritable. Response level deteriorates as the condition", "develops. Bleeding, swelling or bruising of the Severe headache. Soft, egg shell feeling of the scalp. Pale, clammy to the touch. Flushed, dry skin. Bruising apparent around the eyes. Shallow to normal breathing. Deep, slow and noisy breathing (due to pressure on brain). Bruising or swelling behind one or Rapid, weak pulse. Slow, strong pulse caused by raised Blood or fluid coming from an ear or Pupils are normal and react to light. One or both pupils may dilate as pressure on the brain increases. Deformity or lack of symmetry of the Nausea and vomiting can occur on As condition worsens, fits may occur, with no recovery. Blood visible in the white of the eye. Treatment of head injuries Keep", "in mind that a casualty with any head injury may well be suffering from neck and spine injuries also. Treat the casualty with the utmost care, and call for an ambulance immediately. \uf0b7 If the casualty is or has been unconscious, you suspect a fractured skull, or their responses deteriorate CALL AN AMBULANCE IMMEDIATELY. \uf0b7 Keep their airway clear and monitor their breathing. \uf0b7 If the casualty is unconscious, and you don\u2019t wish to move them as you suspect a neck injury, you can use the jaw thrust method of keeping the airway clear \uf0b7 If you are unable to use the jaw thrust method, and you cannot keep the airway clear, put the casualty in the recovery position but", "make sure the head, neck and body are in line as you turn them to avoid any further damage to a neck or spinal injury. \uf0b7 If the casualty is conscious, you can help them lie down, making sure to keep the head and neck in line with the body. You can help stop any movement of their head by placing your hands on either side of the head and keeping it still. \uf0b7 If there is bleeding, help to control it by applying pressure directly to or around the wound. However, if there is blood or fluid coming from an ear, do not try to stop the flow, as the fluid must be allowed to drain. \uf0b7 If there", "are any other injuries on the casualty, attempt to treat these. Some tips for treating head injuries: \uf0b7 Monitor the casualty\u2019s breathing, pulse and response levels. If the casualty appears to recover, monitor them closely as they may well deteriorate and their response levels drop. \uf0b7 If a casualty has been concussed, try to make sure they are not left alone for the next 24 hours. Advise them to seek medical help as soon as possible. \uf0b7 If a casualty suffers any of the following in the few days after concussion, they should go to A&E immediately: worsening headache, nausea or vomiting, drowsiness, weakness in a limb, problems speaking, dizzy spells, blood or fluid from an ear or the nose,", "problems seeing, seizures or confusion. \uf0b7 If the concussion is received playing sports, do not allow the concussed player to continue until they have seen a doctor. Usually, concussed players are not allowed to participate for up to three weeks after being concussed. Strokes must always be treated as a medical emergency, and an ambulance called immediately. Any delay in the treatment of a stroke can have a dramatic effect on the casualty\u2019s recovery. If you suspect a stroke, CALL AN AMBULANCE IMMEDIATELY. There are two types of stroke: 1. A blood clot blocks a blood vessel that supplies part of the brain. This is the 2. A ruptured blood vessel in the brain. The build-up of blood \u2018squashes\u2019 an", "area of the brain. With either type of stroke the signs are similar, with the result that a part of the brain dies. There is no age definition of a stroke casualty; anyone of any age can have a stroke. Signs and symptoms of a stroke: A stroke must be treated immediately. If you suspect a stroke, carry out the following FAST test: Can the casualty smile? Has their mouth or eye drooped? Can the casualty raise both arms? Can the casualty speak clearly? Do they have problems understanding Time to call 999 If the casualty fails any of these tests, call 999 immediately as a stroke is a medical emergency. There may be other signs to look for, but", "the FAST check is the quickest and may save time. However, please note the following may occur: \uf0b7 One side of the face or body becomes suddenly numb. \uf0b7 Loss of balance. \uf0b7 Lack of co-ordination. \uf0b7 Suddenly developing a severe headache. \uf0b7 Sudden confusion. \uf0b7 Problems seeing with one or both eyes. \uf0b7 Pupil size becomes unequal Treatment of stroke: \uf0b7 Clear the airway and maintain breathing. \uf0b7 DIAL 999 FOR AN AMBULANCE IMMEDIATELY. \uf0b7 If the casualty is unconscious, place in the recovery position. \uf0b7 If conscious, lay the casualty down with their head and shoulders raised. \uf0b7 Be sure to talk to and reassure the casualty. Just because they may not be able to speak, they still", "may be able to understand and react to you. \uf0b7 Monitor their breathing, pulse and response levels. Keep a record if possible for when the ambulance arrives. Hypoxia means low oxygen in the blood stream. This condition has the potential to be fatal, so it is vital for a first aider to recognise the signs and know how to treat the casualty. There are five categories for the causes of hypoxia. These are: There is not enough oxygen in the air surrounding the casualty, such as: \uf0b7 Suffocation by smoke or gas. \uf0b7 Suffocation by earth, sand or a pillow/cushion, etc. \uf0b7 High altitude (lower oxygen levels) These can be swelling or narrowing of the airway caused by: \uf0b7 Swallowing", "or swelling of the tongue. \uf0b7 Strangulation. \uf0b7 Anaphylactic shock. Breathing causes The lungs are unable to function properly, caused by: \uf0b7 Crushing of the chest. \uf0b7 A collapsed lung. \uf0b7 Injury to the chest. \uf0b7 Asthma attack. \uf0b7 Disease or illness. Circulation causes Oxygenated blood is unable to circulate around the body, falling blood pressure, or oxygen is not absorbed by the blood, caused by: \uf0b7 Cardiac arrest. \uf0b7 Severe bleeding. Control centre causes The respiratory control centre in the brain, or the nerves connecting it to the lungs, fails, caused by: \uf0b7 Drug overdose. \uf0b7 Spinal injury. \uf0b7 Electric shock. Signs and symptoms of hypoxia \uf0b7 Skin appears pale and feels clammy to the touch. For dark skinned", "casualties, check the skin inside the lips and eyelids. \uf0b7 A bluish tinge to the casualty\u2019s skin and lips (cyanosis). \uf0b7 Increased pulse. \uf0b7 Weakening pulse. \uf0b7 Nausea or vomiting. \uf0b7 An increase to the casualty\u2019s breathing rate (caused by lack of oxygen). \uf0b7 A decrease to the casualty\u2019s breathing rate (check for control centre causes). \uf0b7 Distressed breathing, or gasping. \uf0b7 Confused or dizzy. \uf0b7 Decreasing levels of consciousness. \uf0b7 Look for clues from the cause of the hypoxia (bleeding, injury, chest pain, Treatment of hypoxia \uf0b7 Clear the airway and maintain breathing. \uf0b7 Try to remove or treat the cause of hypoxia (stop bleeds, open windows to clear smoke or gas, etc.). \uf0b7 Do not allow the casualty", "to eat, drink or smoke. How the body responds to hypoxia Adrenalin is released if the body detects that there are low levels of oxygen in the blood. The effect this has on a body is: \uf0b7 Increases the heart rate. \uf0b7 Increases the strength of the heartbeat, and therefore blood pressure. \uf0b7 Diverts blood away from the skin, stomach and intestines. \uf0b7 Diverts the blood towards the brain, heart and lungs. \uf0b7 Dilates the air passages (bronchioles) in the lungs. Adrenaline being released into the body has a dramatic effect on the signs and symptoms that it is vital you as the first aider recognise. The respiratory system Air is taken in through the nose and mouth where it", "is warmed, filtered and moistened. It then travels through the throat and past the epiglottis (the flap of skin at the back of the throat that closes over the airway when we swallow), where it enters the larynx (the voice box or \u2018Adam\u2019s apple\u2019). It then continues between the vocal cords in the larynx and on into the trachea (windpipe). The trachea is protected by cartilage rings that surround it and stop it from kinking. The trachea then splits into two \u2018bronchi\u2019, each supplying oxygen to a lung. The bronchi are divided into \u2018bronchioles\u2019, or smaller air passages. Right at the end of the bronchioles are \u2018alveoli\u2019, microscopic air sacks. The walls of the alveoli are one cell thick, which", "allows oxygen to pass through them and into the blood, which is carried in capillaries around the alveoli. The waste gas from our body is carbon dioxide, which passes from the blood through the alveoli and is breathed out. The \u2018thoracic cavity\u2019 is in the chest, and is where the trachea, bronchi and lungs are all situated. To enable us to draw air into the thoracic cavity, the diaphragm flattens and the chest walls expand, which increases the size of the thoracic cavity creating a void which draws in air. Each lung is encased in a two layered membrane known as the \u2018pleura\u2019. Between these two layers is a thin layer of fluid called \u2018serous fluid\u2019. This allows the chest", "walls to move without friction. The ribs curl around from the spine, connecting to the sternum (breast bone), and protects the thoracic cavity. \u2018Normal\u2019 respiratory rates Breaths per minute Choking is a very common occurrence, and is probably one of the most useful skills you can have as a first aider. Choking can lead to tragedy if not dealt with Signs and symptoms \uf0b7 Casualty is unable to talk, breath or cough. \uf0b7 They may be gasping and clutching their throat. \uf0b7 They may appear distressed. \uf0b7 They may become pale and show signs of cyanosis in later stages. \uf0b7 Becoming unconscious.

Do not leave the casualty alone. \uf0b7 Bend the casualty forward at the waist so their head is lower than the chest. If the casualty is a young child, you can place them over the knee to help with \uf0b7 Find the hollow spot between the shoulder blades and administer five firm slaps with your open hand.

Choking in a baby under 1 year The baby may attempt to cough on their own. If the choking is not serious, this will clear the obstruction. The baby may cry which indicates they are now breathing properly. If the obstruction is not cleared by coughing, follow the steps below: \uf0b7 Shout for help immediately, but do not leave the baby alone. \uf0b7 Lay the baby over your arm facing downwards with their legs either side of your elbow with their head below their chest. \uf0b7 Administer up to five slaps firmly between the shoulder blades with the palms of your fingers, not your open hand. \uf0b7 Check between", "each slap if the obstruction has dislodged. \uf0b7 If this does not work go to step 2. 2 \u2013 Chest thrusts \uf0b7 Turn the baby over, so they are laying chest up on your other arm, keep their head below their chest. \uf0b7 Using two fingers on the baby\u2019s chest give up to 5 chest thrusts.

If the obstruction has still not dislodged repeat steps 1 and 2.", "If the casualty becomes unconscious make sure they are laying on the ground (or on a flat firm surface for a baby) and commence CPR. Make sure there is an ambulance on the way. Continue CPR until help arrives or you become fatigued. Anaphylactic shock Anaphylaxis is an extreme allergic reaction which can be fatal. This is trigged by a massive over reaction by the immune system. Severe anaphylactic reaction is a rare occurrence, usually triggered by drugs such as penicillin, insect stings, nuts such as peanuts and shellfish such as prawns, latex, dairy produce, etc. When the body detects a \u2018foreign protein\u2019 the immune cells release histamine. Histamine can have the following effects on the body if released in", "massive \uf0b7 Dilates blood vessels. \uf0b7 Constricts the bronchioles in lungs. \uf0b7 Makes blood capillary walls weaken and leak, which causes severe swelling \uf0b7 Weakens the heart\u2019s contractions. \uf0b7 Makes the skin itchy and come out in a rash.

Treatment of anaphylactic shock \uf0b7 Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. \uf0b7 Lay the casualty in as comfortable position as possible. If the casualty is having problems breathing, they may want to sit up to ease this. \uf0b7 If the casualty is feeling faint, do not let them sit up. Keep them lying flat and raise their legs. \uf0b7 If the casualty is aware of their condition, they may be carrying an adrenaline shot. This can save the casualty\u2019s life if administered promptly. \uf0b7 The casualty can usually give themselves the adrenaline shot, but if they are unable you may have to help", "them. \uf0b7 If the casualty becomes unconscious, check their airway and breathing and resuscitate as necessary. \uf0b7 The adrenaline shot (epinephrine) can be given again if there is no improvement, or symptoms return after five minutes. Asthma is a fairly common allergic reaction in the lungs, usually caused by pollution, dust, pollen or traffic fumes. The muscles surrounding the bronchioles spasm and constrict which makes it very difficult for the casualty to breathe. Asthma sufferers normally carry around medication in the form of an inhaler which when breathed in dilates the bronchioles helping to relieve the Asthma attacks can be very traumatic for the casualty, especially children, so be sure to reassure them and keep them as calm as possible.", "This is best achieved by being calm yourself and let them know you are a first aider.

Treatment of croup \uf0b7 Keep calm as panic will distress the child and worsen the attack. \uf0b7 Sit the child upright and keep reassuring them. \uf0b7 Call a doctor. \uf0b7 If the attack is a severe one, does not ease or the child is running a temperature, dial 999 for an ambulance. Never try to put your fingers down the child\u2019s throat as there is a small chance that the condition could be \u2018epiglottitis\u2019. If it is then the epiglottis may swell even more and totally block the child\u2019s airway. Hyperventilation Hyperventilation means \u2018excessive breathing\u2019. When we breathe in we take in a", "trace amount of carbon dioxide and when we breathe out this rises to about 4% carbon dioxide. Hyperventilation results in low levels of carbon dioxide in the blood which is what causes the symptoms of this condition. Hyperventilation attacks can be brought on by anxiety, a panic attack or a sudden fright, and can be confused with an asthma attack. Asthma sufferers may hyperventilate after using their inhalers, once their airway has opened. The difference can be told by the large amounts of air being taken in by the hyperventilating casualty compared to the tight, wheezing breath of the asthma Signs and symptoms \uf0b7 Unnaturally fast deep breathing. \uf0b7 Dizziness and faintness. \uf0b7 Complaining of a \u2018tight\u2019 chest. \uf0b7 Cramping", "in the hands and feet. \uf0b7 Flush skin, and no signs of cyanosis. \uf0b7 Pins and needles in the arms and hands. \uf0b7 The casualty may feel they can\u2019t breathe. \uf0b7 A prolonged hyperventilation attack may result in the casualty passing out, and may stop breathing for up to 30 seconds. Treatment of hyperventilation \uf0b7 Reassure the casualty, but be firm and stay calm. \uf0b7 Move them to a quiet, preferably isolated area. \uf0b7 Explain to the casualty that they are hyperventilating and need to calm down. \uf0b7 Try to coach their breathing, slowing it and calming them. \uf0b7 Ask the casualty to take tiny sips of water. This will reduce the amount of breaths they can take. \uf0b7 Ask", "them to breathe through their nose, as this reduces the loss of carbon dioxide. They may need lots of reassurance to do this. \uf0b7 If the attack continues, or you are in any doubt, seek medical advice. It is a misconception that drowning victims breathe in a large amount of water. In truth, 90% of drowning fatalities are caused by a relatively small amount of water in the lungs which interferes with the oxygen exchange in the alveoli (known as wet drowning). The other 10% are caused by spasms in the muscles near the epiglottis and larynx which blocks the airway (known as dry drowning). The casualty will have swallowed a large amount of water, which may be vomited during", "resuscitation. Please remember that drowning can have many factors such as alcohol, hypothermia or a medical condition such as heart attack or epilepsy. Secondary Drowning: When a small amount of water is taken into the lungs it causes irritation and fluid is drawn from the blood into the alveoli. This reaction could happen several hours after a near drowning, the casualty may relapse after appearing to have recovered fully and have difficulty breathing later on. This is why any drowning casualty who has been resuscitated should be taken to hospital as a matter of urgency. Treatment of drowning Firstly, do not endanger yourself as you getting in trouble won\u2019t help the casualty. Try not to enter the water yourself unless", "you have been trained to do so. If possible, try to reach the casualty with a stick, rope or a floating object (lifesavers or similar). \uf0b7 Do not put yourself at risk. Try to reach the casualty with a rope, stick or float. \uf0b7 Try to keep the casualty horizontal during the rescue as they may go into \uf0b7 Check their airway and breathing. Perform CPR if necessary. \uf0b7 Dial 999 for an ambulance. Do this even if they appear to have fully recovered, as secondary drowning may occur. Collapsed lung / sucking chest wound The lungs are surrounded by two layers of membrane, known as the \u2018pleura\u2019. Between the membranes is a \u2018pleural cavity\u2019 which contains a very thin", "layer of \u2018serous fluid\u2019. This fluid enables the layers to move against each other as we A casualty with a penetrating chest injury will have had the outer layer of the pleura damaged. This causes air to be sucked in from the outside of the chest into the pleural cavity which in turn causes the lung to collapse (pneumothorax). With any serious chest injury the inner layer of the pleura may become perforated, which will cause air to be drawn from the lung into the pleural cavity causing the lung to collapse. If air is continuously drawn into the pleural cavity, but is unable to escape, pressure will build in the collapsed lung (tension pneumothorax). This pressure may squeeze both", "the heart and uninjured lung preventing both from functioning properly. Signs and symptoms \uf0b7 Severe difficulty breathing. \uf0b7 Cyanosis of skin and lips (grey or bluish colouration). \uf0b7 Painful breathing. \uf0b7 Clammy, pale skin. \uf0b7 Breathing is fast and shallow. \uf0b7 Chest will not move symmetrically as the injured side may not rise. If there is a sucking chest wound \uf0b7 Sound of air being drawn into the wound along with bubbling blood. \uf0b7 \u2018Crackling\u2019 feeling to the skin around the wound due to air entry. Treatment of collapsed lung / sucking chest wound \uf0b7 Immediately cover the wound with either your, or the casualty\u2019s hand (if they are conscious) to help prevent air being sucked in. \uf0b7 Dial 999", "immediately for an ambulance. Ask someone to do this if you are \uf0b7 Place a sterile pad over the wound and cover with plastic (cling film, kitchen foil or any other air tight covering will do). \uf0b7 Tape the plastic covering on three sides only, as you want to stop air getting in but not getting out. \uf0b7 If the casualty loses consciousness, open the airway and check their breathing. \uf0b7 Perform CPR if necessary. If they are breathing, place them in the recovery position with the injured lung lowest, to help protect the uninjured lung. This refers to a condition where the ribs surrounding the chest have been fractured in several places creating a \u2018floating\u2019 section in the chest", "wall. As the casualty draws breath the chest moves normally, but the flail section will move inwards and outwards when the rest of the chest is moving outwards and inwards. These are known as paradoxical chest movements. Signs and symptoms \uf0b7 Severe breathing difficulties. \uf0b7 Painful, shallow breathing. \uf0b7 Same signs and symptoms of a fracture. \uf0b7 Paradoxical chest movement. Treatment of flail chest \uf0b7 Dial 999 immediately for an ambulance. \uf0b7 Place the casualty in the most comfortable position for them, preferably sat up and inclined towards the injury. \uf0b7 Place large amounts of padding over the flail area. \uf0b7 Put the arm of the injured side in an elevated sling, squeezing the arm gently against the padding to", "help provide gentle, firm support to the injury. The circulatory system The circulatory system consists of a closed network of tubes (arteries, veins and capillaries) which are all connected to a pump (the heart). Arteries carry the blood away from the heart. They have strong, muscular, elastic walls which expand as the blood from the heart surges through them. The largest artery is the \u2018aorta\u2019, which connects directly to the heart. Veins carry the blood towards the heart. Their walls are thinner than artery walls as the blood they carry is under less pressure. They have one way valves to keep the blood flowing towards the heart. The largest veins are the \u2018vena cava\u2019, which connect to the heart. Capillaries", "are tiny blood vessels which float between the arteries and veins and carry oxygen, carbon dioxide and nutrients in and out of the body\u2019s cells. The heart is basically a four chambered pump. The left and right sides are separate. The left side of the heart takes oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it around the body, whereas the right side of the heart takes blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs. The two sides are separated into two chambers known as the \u2018atria\u2019 and the \u2018ventricles\u2019. The atria are the top chambers which collect blood as it returns from both the lungs and the body, pumping it to the ventricles. The ventricles in turn pump", "the blood out of the heart to the lungs and around the body. 60% of blood is made up of a clear yellow fluid called \u2018plasma\u2019. Within the plasma are red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and nutrients. Red cells contain haemoglobin, which carries oxygen that is used by the body\u2019s cells. Red cells give blood its colour. White cells are what help us fight infections. Platelets trigger complicated chemical reactions if a blood vessel is damaged Nutrients are derived from food by the digestive system. When nutrients are combined with oxygen within the cells of the body they provide energy, keeping the cells alive. \uf0b7 The blood carries carbon dioxide (waste gas produced by the cells) in the", "form of \u2018carbonic acid\u2019, which is diluted within the plasma. \uf0b7 The blood also circulates heat (generated mostly by the liver). This heat is carried to the skin by the blood if the body needs cooling down. Whenever the heart contracts, blood is pumped through the arteries. The elastic walls of the arteries expand as the blood flows through them, which can be felt wherever arteries come close to the skin. When you check a pulse use the pads of your fingers not your thumb, as thumbs have their own pulse. The first aider should make a note of the following when checking for a pulse: Rate \u2013 Is the pulse slow or fast? Count how many beats there are", "in a minute. Rhythm \u2013 Is there a regular pulse? Are there any beats missed? Strength \u2013 Is the pulse strong or weak? The main areas you will find a pulse are in the neck (carotid pulse), the wrist (radial pulse) and in the upper arm (brachial pulse). Normal heart rate at rest Capillary refill Circulation to the end of the arms and legs can be momentarily checked by squeezing the tip of a finger or toe. The skin will appear pale when squeezed \u2013 if the circulation is working properly the colour will return within two seconds when released. This process can take a little longer if the hands or feet are cold. Angina (angina pectoris) is a condition", "that is usually caused by the build-up of cholesterol plaque on the lining of a coronary artery. Cholesterol is a fatty chemical that is part of the outer lining of cells in the body. Cholesterol plaque is a hard, thick substance which builds up from the deposits of cholesterol on the artery wall. Over time the build-up of cholesterol plaque causes the arteries to narrow and harden. When we exercise or get excited the heart requires more oxygen, but the narrowed arteries are not able to increase the blood supply that is being demanded. The result of this is an area of the heart will suffer from a lack of oxygen. The casualty will feel pain in the chest as", "a result. Usually angina attacks occur with exertion but subside with rest. However, if the narrowing of the artery reaches a critical level angina may occur during rest (known as \u2018unstable angina\u2019). Casualties with angina, especially unstable angina, are at a high risk of suffering from a heart attack in the near future. A heart attack (myocardial infarction) is usually caused when the surface of a cholesterol plaque build-up in a coronary artery cracks and develops a \u2018rough surface\u2019. This may lead to a blood clot forming on the plaque which in turn completely blocks the artery resulting in the death of an area of the heart However, unlike angina, the death of the heart muscle from a heart attack", "is permanent and will not be eased with rest. Signs and symptoms Please bear in mind that each heart attack is different. They may not show all the signs below, in fact up to a quarter of heart attacks are \u2018silent\u2019 and happen without any chest pain. Sudden, during exertion, stress or extreme Sudden and can occur at rest. \u2018Vicelike\u2019 pain, can be described as \u2018dull\u2019, \u2018tightness\u2019 or \u2018pressure\u2019 in the chest.

Try to stop them from walking around", "or doing anything strenuous. Sit them in the Fowler position (or the \u2018W\u2019 position). Have them lean against a wall, or your knees if no other option, and raise their knees. \uf0b7 Ask the casualty if they have any medication with them. If they do, allow them to take their own glyceryl tri-nitrate (G.T.N.) medication if they have it. DO NOT GIVE IT TO THEM DIRECTLY BUT HELP THEM SELF \uf0b7 Reassure the casualty. Remove any causes of stress or anxiety if possible. \uf0b7 If you have any reason to suspect a heart attack \u2013 check if the casualty is allergic to aspirin, older than 16 or if they are taking any \u2018anti-coagulant\u2019 drugs such as warfarin. If all is", "clear, allow them to chew an aspirin tablet slowly, as this may be beneficial. If, however, you are unsure of any of the above, wait for the ambulance to arrive. \uf0b7 Monitor the casualty. If it is a heart attack and the casualty becomes unconscious it is more than likely the heart has stopped and you will need to perform CPR, so be prepared. Aspirin helps stop clotting in the blood. Having a casualty chew an aspirin tablet allows the drug to be absorbed into the blood stream through the skin of the mouth, helping it work faster. The ideal dose of aspirin is 300mg, but any strength will do in these cases. Dial 999 for an ambulance if: \uf0b7", "You have any reason to suspect it is a heart attack. \uf0b7 The casualty has no history of angina. \uf0b7 The symptoms suffered are different or worse than the casualty\u2019s usual angina \uf0b7 The pain from an angina attack is not relieved by the casualty\u2019s medication and rest after 15 minutes. \uf0b7 You have any doubts at all. It is always better to be safe than sorry in these Left ventricular failure Left ventricular failure (LVF) is where the left ventricular of the heart loses power and cannot empty itself. The right side of the heart is still working and pumping blood into the lungs. This causes a \u2018back pressure\u2019 of blood in the pulmonary veins and arteries in the", "lungs. Fluid from the back pressure of blood seeps into the alveoli which results in severe breathing difficulties. The condition may be brought on by a heart attack, chronic heart failure or high blood pressure. Casualties with chronic heart failure more often than not suffer attacks at night. Signs and symptoms \uf0b7 Severe breathing difficulties. \uf0b7 Crackly, wheezy breathing due to fluid on the lungs. \uf0b7 Pale, sweaty skin. \uf0b7 Cyanosis of the skin/lips (grey or bluish discolouration). \uf0b7 Coughing up frothy, bloody sputum. \uf0b7 Possibly the same signs and symptoms of heart attack. \uf0b7 Casualty needs to sit up to be able to breathe. \uf0b7 Confusion, dizziness and anxiety. Treatment of LVF \uf0b7 Sit the casualty upright, with their", "feet dangling. \uf0b7 Dial 999 for an ambulance as soon as you can. \uf0b7 If the casualty has it, allow them to take their own G.T.N. medication. \uf0b7 Be prepared to perform CPR as this condition can deteriorate rapidly. The usual association with the word shock is a nasty surprise, an earthquake or electrical shock. The medical definition of shock is \u2018inadequate tissue perfusion, caused by a fall in blood pressure and blood volume\u2019. This means there is an inadequate supply of oxygenated blood to the tissues of the body. Understanding what shock is can help understand why casualties who are in shock need immediate treatment, or the condition can result in death. The most common causes of life threatening", "shock are: \uf0b7 Hypovolaemic Shock. \uf0b7 Cardiogenic Shock. \uf0b7 Anaphylactic Shock. Hypovolaemic Shock Hypovolaemic shock is caused by loss of bodily fluids, the result of which is low blood volume. Hypovolaemic shock is usually caused by: \uf0b7 External bleeding. \uf0b7 Internal bleeding. \uf0b7 Vomiting and diarrhoea. \uf0b7 Excessive sweating. Signs and symptoms Usually the first response is a release of adrenaline which will cause: \uf0b7 Pulse rate to rise. \uf0b7 Pale, clammy skin. For dark skinned casualties check the colour of the skin inside the lips. As the condition deteriorates: \uf0b7 Shallow, fast breathing. \uf0b7 Nausea or vomiting. \uf0b7 Weak, rapid pulse. \uf0b7 Dizziness or weakness. \uf0b7 Cyanosis (grey/blue tinge to lips and skin). As the brain receives less oxygen:", "\uf0b7 Deep, sighing breathing (air hunger). \uf0b7 Unconsciousness. \uf0b7 Anxiety, confusion, possible aggression. Treatment of Hypovolaemic Shock \uf0b7 Try to treat the cause of the shock (e.g. external bleeding). \uf0b7 Lay the casualty on a flat surface (preferably the floor) and raise their legs so they are above the chest (heart). This will cause the blood to return to the vital organs as 40% of the body\u2019s blood is in the legs. Take care if you suspect a fracture. \uf0b7 Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. \uf0b7 Keep the casualty warm \u2013 place a blanket or coat under the casualty if they are on the floor or other cold surface. However, be careful not to overheat them as this dilates", "the blood vessels which will cause their blood pressure to drop \uf0b7 Do not allow the casualty to drink, eat or smoke. Nil by mouth is best! \uf0b7 Loosen any tight clothing such as ties and belts. \uf0b7 Monitor the casualty\u2019s breathing, pulse and response levels. \uf0b7 Be prepared to perform CPR. Cardiogenic Shock This form of shock occurs when there is a fall in blood pressure caused by the heart not pumping properly. This is the most common type of shock. Typical causes of cardiogenic shock are: \uf0b7 Tension pneumothorax. \uf0b7 Cardiac failure. \uf0b7 Cardiac arrest. \uf0b7 Heart valve disease. Signs, symptoms and treatment of cardiogenic shock See section on heart conditions (page 30). Anaphylactic Shock Anaphylaxis is an", "extremely dangerous allergic reaction which is brought on by a massive over-reaction of the body\u2019s immune system (see page 22). An anaphylactic reaction may result in shock due to a large quantity of histamine. This can result in: \uf0b7 Blood vessels dilating which causes blood pressure to fall. \uf0b7 Blood capillary walls may become \u2018leaky\u2019 causing blood volume to fall. \uf0b7 Weakening of the heart\u2019s contractions which causes blood pressure to fall. Signs, symptoms and treatment See section on anaphylaxis (see page 22) This reaction is caused by poor nervous control of the blood vessels and the When a casualty faints the blood vessels in the lower body usually dilate which slows the heart. This results in falling blood pressure", "and the casualty has a temporary reduction in blood supply to the brain. Typical causes of fainting are: \uf0b7 Fright or pain. \uf0b7 Extended periods of inactivity (such as standing or sitting). \uf0b7 Emotional stress. \uf0b7 Heat exhaustion. Signs and symptoms \uf0b7 Temporary loss of consciousness resulting in falling to the floor. \uf0b7 Before fainting the casualty may have had nausea, blurred vision, stomach ache or dizziness. \uf0b7 Clammy, pale skin. \uf0b7 Quick to recover. Treatment of fainting \uf0b7 Lay the casualty on a flat surface, preferably the floor and raise their legs which will return the blood to the vital organs and raise blood pressure. \uf0b7 Check the casualty\u2019s airway and breathing. \uf0b7 Try to remove the cause of", "stress such as people crowding the casualty and allow plenty of fresh air. \uf0b7 Reassure the casualty as they come to. Try to stop them from sitting up \uf0b7 If the casualty feels faint again, repeat the treatment and check for an underlying cause. \uf0b7 If the casualty does not recover in a short amount of time and remain unconscious, or you are unsure: check the airway and breathing again, place them in the recovery position and dial 999 for an ambulance. Wounds and bleeding A wound is an abnormal break in the continuity of the tissues of the body. Any wound will, to a greater or lesser extent, result in either internal or external bleeding. Severe blood loss could", "result in shock, so it is important to treat wounds promptly. There are several types of wound \u2013 identification and treatment are detailed here. Types and basic treatment of wounds Contusion is a bruise. Contusions are caused by ruptured capillaries bleeding under the skin. Typically these are caused by a blow or by bleeds caused by an underlying problem such as a fracture. \uf0b7 Put an ice pack on the affected area, or place the area under cold running water as soon as possible. Abrasion is a graze. This is the result of the top layer of skin being scraped off, usually as the result of a sliding fall or a friction burn. Abrasions can often contain particles of dirt", "which could lead to infection. \uf0b7 Any dirt that is not embedded in the graze should be removed with clean water and sterile swabs. \uf0b7 Always clean from the centre of the wound outwards to reduce the risk of introducing more dirt into the wound. Laceration is a rip or tear in the skin. These are more likely to have particles of dirt than a cut but tend to bleed less. \uf0b7 Treat as a bleed (see page 36) and prevent infection. Incision is a clean cut. These wounds are usually caused by a sharp object, such as broken glass or a knife. If the wound is deep it could provide complications such as severed tendons or blood vessels. These", "wounds tend to bleed freely and may even \u2018gape open\u2019. \uf0b7 Treat as a bleed (see page 36) and prevent infection. Puncture is a stab wound. These wounds can be caused by such implements as a nail or actually being stabbed. The wound is likely to be deep but may appear to be small in diameter. Damage may be deep, hitting underlying organs such as the lungs or heart, and may cause severe internal bleeding. \uf0b7 Dial 999 for an ambulance if you suspect the wound has penetrated deep enough to damage any organs or cause internal bleeding. \uf0b7 If the object is embedded in the puncture do not remove it as it may be stemming the bleed, and removal", "may cause further damage. Gun shot is caused by a bullet or other missile travelling at a high enough speed to drive into and possibly exit the body. There may be a small entry wound and a larger, \u2018crater\u2019 exit wound. Severe damage to internal organs should be assumed, and will be accompanied by severe bleeding. \uf0b7 Dial 999 for both an ambulance and the police. \uf0b7 Clear the casualty\u2019s airway and check for breathing first. Be prepared to \uf0b7 Pack the wound with dressings if possible to prevent further bleeding. Amputation is the complete or partial removal of a limb. \uf0b7 See the section on amputation (see page 43). De-gloved is the severing of the skin from the body,", "which results in a \u2018creasing\u2019 or a flap of skin coming away and leaving a bare area of tissue. These wounds are usually caused by the force of an object sliding along the length of the skin, in effect skinning it. \uf0b7 If possible, put the skin back in place. \uf0b7 Arrange transport to hospital urgently. How much blood does a body have? The amount of blood in a body varies depending on the size of the person. However, a rough guide is that we have approximately a pint of blood for every stone in weight (0.5 litres per 7kg) so the average adult will have between 8 and 12 pints (4.5 to 6.5 litres) of blood depending on their", "size. However, this rule does not work for someone who is overweight. Bear in mind that children have less blood than adults and cannot afford to lose anywhere near the same amount. A baby has only approximately 1 pint of blood and can only afford to lose 1/3 of a pint before their blood pressure falls. Types of bleeding Arterial bleeds tend to spurt from wounds in time with the heart-beat, as blood in the arteries is under direct pressure from the heart. A wound to a major artery may result in the blood \u2018spurting\u2019 several meters instantly with the blood volume rapidly reducing over time. Blood in the arteries is highly oxygenated and will be bright red, however this", "may be difficult to assess so do not rely on it as a form of identification. More importantly is how the wound is bleeding. Venous wounds are damage to veins which carry blood that is not under direct pressure from the heart, but may carry the same volume of blood as the arteries. Wounds to a major vein could \u2018ooze\u2019 profusely. Capillary bleeds occur in all wounds. These bleeds may appear fast at first, blood loss form capillary bleeds tend to be slight and is easily controlled. Capillary bleeds tend to be described as a \u2018trickle\u2019. Dealing with wounds hygienically \uf0b7 Be sure to protect yourself by covering any of your own cuts or abrasions with a waterproof dressing, especially", "if they are on your hands or arms. \uf0b7 If they are available, wear disposable gloves and apron when administering first aid to wounds. \uf0b7 Use specific cleaning products for cleaning up bodily fluids. Always follow the instructions and use disposable towels. \uf0b7 Always dispose of soiled dressings or disposable towels used to clean up bodily fluid in a yellow \u2018clinical waste\u2019 container. These need to be taken away and incinerated (send the container to the hospital with the casualty if you have no clinical waste facilities where you are). \uf0b7 Always wash your hands thoroughly before and after dealing with a casualty. This helps reduce the risk of infection. \uf0b7 If you are dealing with body fluids on a", "regular basis, ask your doctor about vaccination against hepatitis \u2018B\u2019. The effects of blood loss Please see the table below for the effects, signs and symptoms of blood loss. The table gives the volume of blood loss as a percentage as we all have different quantities of blood, depending on the size of the person. Please note that a casualty who has lost 30% of their blood is in a critical condition, and will deteriorate rapidly from this point onwards. Blood vessels cannot constrict anymore and the heart cannot beat any faster so their blood pressure will fall, resulting in unconsciousness and death. Also, please be aware that any casualty who has lost over 10% of their blood should be", "treated for shock (see page 33). See also hypovolaemic shock (see page 33/4) and hypoxia (see page 16). 40% + Blood loss Could feel dizzy Lowered levels of Restless & anxious Cyanosis (blue/grey tinge of skin & lips), Severe cyanosis, cold Normal (this is the usual amount taken bpm), hard to detect Deep sighing breaths Treatment of external bleeding The aim of treating external bleeding is firstly to stop the bleed, then prevent the casualty from going into shock and finally to prevent infection. The acronym SEEP should help you to remember the following steps: Sit or lay the casualty down, ensuring they are in a position that is appropriate for the location of the wound. Examine the wound for", "foreign objects and make a note of how the wound is bleeding. Make sure to tell the medical staff how the wound was bleeding once it is covered with a bandage. Elevate the wound so that it is above the heart, which will use gravity to restrict the flow of blood to the injury. Apply direct or indirect pressure to help slow the bleeding. Direct pressure: Direct pressure to the wound is the best way of stemming a bleed. You can use your hands to do this, but you should take precautions to minimise the risk of coming in contact with the casualty\u2019s blood, preferably by wearing disposable gloves. Keep pressure on the wound continuously for at least ten minutes.", "Using a firm bandage usually stops the bleeding with most minor wounds (make sure the bandage is not so tight as to cut off the circulation to the limb altogether). If there is a foreign object embedded in the wound do not remove it but you may be able to apply pressure at either side of the object. Indirect pressure: If it is not possible or effective to apply direct pressure to a wound, you can use indirect pressure as a last resort. This is achieved by applying pressure to the artery which is supplying blood to the limb, pressing it against the bone beneath, reducing the blood flow. This should be done for a maximum of ten There are", "two indirect pressure points: This artery runs along the inside of the upper arm. To help with this, ask the casualty to make a fist with the opposite hand and place it under the arm pit of the injured arm and ask them to squeeze down on the fist. This artery is located where the thigh bone (femur) crosses the \u2018bikini\u2019 line. If applying indirect pressure here, be sure to explain briefly to the casualty what you are doing and why. One way of applying indirect pressure here is to use the heel of your foot. Dressings should be sterile and just large enough to cover the wound. They should be made out of a material that will not stick", "to the clotting blood and be absorbent (a \u2018non-adherent\u2019 dressing). Usually, a firmly applied dressing is enough to stem bleeding from the majority of minor wounds, but any dressing should not restrict the flow of blood to the rest of the limb (you can check the circulation with a \u2018capillary refill\u2019 test, see If the bleeding is severe, it may be necessary to apply direct pressure by hand and elevate the wound. If the dressing becomes soaked with blood, put a larger dressing on the top. If the bleeding continues and soaks the second dressing, remove both dressings and start again. This is to ensure any bacteria is removed from the wound with the first bandage. Embedded objects Objects embedded", "in a wound: If there is an object embedded in the wound (other than a small splinter) you should not attempt to remove it as it may be stemming a severe bleed, or further damage may result. Use sterile dressings and bandages to build up around the object, which will supply the pressure needed to stem the bleed and help support the object. Take the casualty to hospital to have the object removed safely. If there is a splinter deeply embedded, difficult to remove or in a joint, do not try to remove it but follow the advice for embedded objects as above. If the splinter can be removed, follow the below advice: \uf0b7 Carefully use warm soapy water to", "clean the area. \uf0b7 Use a clean pair of tweezers to grip the splinter as close to the visible base as possible. Gently pull the splinter out at the same angle it entered at. \uf0b7 Gently squeeze around the wound to encourage a little bleeding then wash the wound and cover with a dry dressing. \uf0b7 Ask the casualty if they have had a tetanus shot in the last ten years, if not suggest they get one as soon as possible. Objects embedded in the ears, nose or other orifice: If there is a foreign body stuck in a casualty\u2019s ear, nose or other orifice, do not attempt to remove it. Take them directly to hospital where it will be", "safely Nose bleeds are usually the result of weakened or dried out blood tissues in the nose. A nose bleed can be triggered by a bang to the nose, picking or blowing it. However, it can be the symptom of a more serious problem such as high blood pressure or a fractured skull. \uf0b7 Have the casualty sit with their head tipped forward to allow the blood to \uf0b7 Gently pinch the soft part of the nose, and maintain constant pressure for 10 \uf0b7 Tell the casualty to breathe through their mouth. \uf0b7 Give the casualty some tissues or a cloth to clean up the blood while you maintain pressure on the soft part of the nose. \uf0b7 Once the", "bleeding has stopped, recommend to the casualty that they try to continue breathing through their mouth and not blow their nose for the next couple of hours as this may trigger another nose bleed. \uf0b7 However, if the bleeding continues for more than 30 minutes, or they take an \u2018anti-coagulant\u2019 drug (e.g. warfarin), get them to hospital ensuring they stay in an upright position. \uf0b7 If the casualty has a history of frequent nose bleeds, recommend they visit their doctor to determine why. If there are small particles of dust or dirt in the eye, this can be easily washed out using cold tap water. Make sure the water runs away from the good eye. For more serious eye injuries:", "\uf0b7 Try to keep the casualty still and calm. Gently place a soft, sterile dressing over the injured eye. You can tape it in place if necessary. \uf0b7 Ask the casualty to close both their eyes, as any movement of the good eye will cause the injured eye to move too. If necessary, you can place a bandage over the good eye to prevent it moving. Please be sure to give the casualty lots of reassurance at this point! If you can, take the casualty to A&E. Dial 999 for an ambulance if you cannot take the casualty to A&E yourself. For chemical eye injuries: Make sure you are wearing protective gloves if possible. Wash the injured eye with lots", "of clean tap water, making sure the water runs away from the good eye. Gently, but firmly try to open the casualty\u2019s eye fully to wash it as much as possible. Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. Amputation is defined as the full or partial severing of a limb, and is extremely traumatic for the casualty. The priority here is to stop the bleeding, then preserve the amputated limb and reassure the casualty. \uf0b7 Immediately treat the casualty for bleeding (see page 36) and shock (see page \uf0b7 Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. \uf0b7 Cover the wound with a low adherent, non-fluffy dressing. \uf0b7 If possible, wrap the amputated part in a plastic bag and place on or in", "a bag of ice to preserve it as much as possible. Do not allow the amputated part to be in contact with the ice or get wet in any way. This type of injury usually occurs on building sites or at road traffic accidents. If the flow of blood to a limb (such as an arm or leg) is restricted by a crushing weight, there is the serious danger of a build-up of toxins in the muscle tissue below the crushing weight. If the flow of blood is restricted to the limb for more than 15 minutes, the toxins will build to such a level that when the weight is removed, and the toxins released into the body, they may", "cause kidney failure. This is known as \u2018crush syndrome\u2019 and may well result in the death of the casualty. In these cases expert medical care is essential when releasing the casualty if the blood flow has been restricted for 15 minutes or more. Treatment for crushing lasting less than 15 minutes: \uf0b7 Remove the crushing weight, or release the casualty as soon as possible. \uf0b7 Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. \uf0b7 Treat any bleeds and cover any open wounds. \uf0b7 Treat the casualty for shock (see page 33), but be sure not to move any \uf0b7 Maintain their airway and monitor their breathing until help arrives. Treatment for crushing lasting more than 15 minutes: \uf0b7 DO NOT RELEASE THE", "CASUALTY. \uf0b7 Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. Give as clear and concise information about the accident as you can. \uf0b7 Maintain their airway and monitor their breathing until help arrives. Internal bleeding This is a very serious condition, but it can be very hard to recognise in the early stages. Internal bleeding can be attributed to lung or abdominal injuries, but can also happen spontaneously to someone who appears well, such as a bleeding stomach ulcer or a weak artery. Even though the blood is not lost from the body, it is lost internally out of veins or arteries and can quickly cause the casualty to go into shock. Internal bleeding can result in serious, life threatening complications such", "as a brain haemorrhage or bleeding into the lungs. Signs and symptoms: You should be aware and looking for internal bleeding if there are signs of the casualty going into shock, but there is no obvious cause such as external \uf0b7 Shock (see page 33). \uf0b7 Pain or a recent history of pain at the site of the bleed. \uf0b7 Bruising and/or swelling. \uf0b7 Other symptoms at the site of the bleed (such as difficulty with breathing if there is bleeding in the lungs). Treatment of internal bleeding: \uf0b7 Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. \uf0b7 Treat the casualty for shock (see page 33). Poisons can be defined as a liquid, solid or gaseous substance that causes damage to the", "body when it enters in sufficient quantity. There are 4 ways a poison can enter the body: The substance is swallowed, either by accident or on purpose. The substance is breathed in, entering the blood stream very quickly through the alveoli. Absorbed The substance comes in contact with skin (see chemical burns, The substance is introduced through the skin directly into tissue or A poison can be one of two things: Corrosive These include acids, bleach, petrol, ammonia, dishwasher powder, turpentine, etc. These include tablets, plants, drugs, perfume, alcohol, etc. Signs and symptoms: There are a wide variety of signs and symptoms for poisoning, depending on the substance. Some clues you can look for are: \uf0b7 Bottles or containers. \uf0b7", "Tablets or drugs. \uf0b7 Syringes or drug taking paraphernalia. \uf0b7 Smell on the casualty\u2019s breath. Some other signs that can accompany poisoning may be: \uf0b7 Nausea, retching or vomiting. \uf0b7 Abdominal pain. \uf0b7 Burns (or a burning sensation) around the area of entry. \uf0b7 Problems breathing. \uf0b7 Hallucinations or confusion. \uf0b7 Unconscious. Sometimes the casualty may start fitting. Treatment for poisoning: For a corrosive substance firstly make sure that your safety is secure \u2013 is it safe to help the casualty? Dilute or wash away the substance if possible: \uf0b7 Substance on the skin \u2013 see chemical burns (see page 49). \uf0b7 Ingested substances \u2013 try to get the casualty to rinse their mouth, then give frequent sips of milk", "or cold water. \uf0b7 Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. Give clear and concise information about the poison if possible.

Burns and scalds Estimating the severity", "of a burn: There are five factors that affect the seriousness of a burn: The larger the area of the burn the more severe it is likely to be. The size is usually given as a percentage of the body\u2019s surface area. An easy way to work out the percentage is to compare the size of the burn to the casualty\u2019s hand. The casualty\u2019s open hand (including the fingers) is the equivalent to 1% of their body area. The cause of the burn will influence the severity of the burn, for example electrical burns could leave the casualty with internal burns and some chemicals (such as hydrofluoric acid) may cause poisoning to the burns as an added complication. The casualty\u2019s", "age will affect the severity of the burn and how long their recovery rate will be. Babies and young children will burn at a lower temperature than adults will. The elderly will take longer to heal from a burn and they may be more susceptible to infection. Location The location of the burn may affect the severity, in particular the inhaling of hot gasses will burn the airway resulting in instant death. Burns to the eye may well result in permanent blindness. The deeper the burn, the more severe it is going to be. Skin consists of three layers, these are the epidermis on the outside, the dermis underneath which lies on a layer of subcutaneous fat. The depth of", "a burn can be defined as: This is a burn only to the outer epidermis layer. This is most commonly caused by scalds. The burn looks sore, red and These burns affect both the epidermis and the dermis. These burns look raw and blisters will form. With this type of burn, both the epidermis and dermis are burned away completely, leaving the exposed subcutaneous fat or beyond. These burns may appear pale, charred or waxy. The casualty\u2019s nerve endings will have been burned away so pain may well be absent which can mislead both you and the Causes of burns and treatment Burns can be separated into five different areas, the treatment for each burn will differ slightly depending on", "the cause. Electrical burns: These burns are caused by heat from an electrical charge flowing through the bodily tissue. You may be able to determine where the current entered the body, and the point of exit, but there will certainly be deep internal burns which are not visible to the eye between the entry and exit burns. The extent of the internal damage can usually be guessed at by the severity of the entry and exit An electric shock may well cause cardiac arrest, so be prepared to perform CPR. Remember in this case that the casualty\u2019s airway and breathing are the \uf0b7 Ensure that it is safe to approach and help the casualty \u2013 never put yourself in harm\u2019s", "way. Make sure the contact between the casualty and the electrical current is broken. \uf0b7 Make sure to maintain the casualty\u2019s airway and breathing. \uf0b7 Try to irrigate the area of the burn, including the area between the entry and exit burns for at least ten minutes. \uf0b7 Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. \uf0b7 Continue treating the casualty as you would for a \u2018dry heat\u2019 burn. These burns are caused by any dry heat source or friction. \uf0b7 Ensure it is safe to approach and help the casualty \u2013 never put yourself in \uf0b7 Make sure to maintain the casualty\u2019s airway and breathing. \uf0b7 Try to take the heat out of the burn by using cold (preferably running) water", "for about 10 to 15 minutes. If water is not readily available, any other cold, non-harmful liquid such as milk may be used, as some cooling to the burn is better than none. Do this initially, and move to an area where there is running water available if possible. Be careful not to cool large areas too much as this may cause hypothermia. \uf0b7 If possible, remove any rings, watches, bangles, etc., during cooling as the burned area will swell. If there is any clothing that is not stuck to the burn it may be removed very carefully. \uf0b7 Use a sterile dressing on the burn, making sure it is one that will not stick. Cling film is one of", "the best ways of dressing a burn, as it doesn\u2019t stick and will stop any infection entering the wound. Remove the first two turns of the roll and apply it lengthwise to the burn. Do not wrap it tightly around the burn as the area may swell and cause further discomfort to the casualty. Secure the cling film with a bandage. \uf0b7 Alternatively, you can use a new, clean plastic bag, low adherent dressing or specialised burn dressings if they are available. However, do not rely on the specialised burn dressing to cool the burn, use cold water to do this. \uf0b7 Dial 999 if the burn appears to be severe or the casualty has breathed in Wet heat burns", "(scalds): Scalds most commonly occur due to contact with boiling water, but can also be from hot fat or other liquids that reach higher temperature than water. \uf0b7 Treat as you would a dry heat burn. These are caused by chemicals coming into contact with the skin which either corrode, create heat, or both. If chemicals are used in your place of work, it is very important for you to learn the correct first aid procedures. Remember, different chemicals require different first aid treatment. \uf0b7 Make sure the area is safe, try to contain the chemical and ensure that you will not come into contact with it. \uf0b7 If the chemical is a dry powder, it can be brushed off", "the casualty\u2019s skin before treatment. Make sure that you protect yourself. \uf0b7 Use lots of cold running water to wash the chemicals off the skin. This should be done for a longer period of time than for a thermal burn, at least 20 minutes. Be careful not to wash the chemical onto unaffected areas of the body. Try not to let any contaminated pools of water collect under the \uf0b7 Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. Take note of what the chemical is and give this information to the ambulance operator if you can. \uf0b7 Carefully remove any contaminated clothing from the casualty while you are washing the burn. \uf0b7 If the chemical is in the casualty\u2019s eye, wash it", "as recommended on page 43, making sure the water runs away from the casualty\u2019s uninjured eye. \uf0b7 Some chemicals cannot be safely diluted with water, in this case health & safety regulations insist that an \u2018antidote\u2019 be available in case of an emergency. You and any other first aider should be trained in the use of the Radiation (sun) burns: These are most commonly seen as sunburn. \uf0b7 Persuade the casualty to get out of the sun, preferably indoors. \uf0b7 Give the casualty frequent sips of water to stave off heat exhaustion (see page \uf0b7 Cool the burns with cold water. If, however, the burns are extensive, cool them under a cool shower or get the casualty to sit in", "a bath of cool water for \uf0b7 If the burns are extensive and blistering, or you are unsure, seek medical \uf0b7 If the burns are mild, then you can apply after sun cream or calamine lotion to help soothe the area.

Never do any of the following when burns are concerned: \uf0b7 Burst a blister or blisters (the blisters are", "there to protect against infection). \uf0b7 Touch the burn. \uf0b7 Apply lotions, ointments or fats to a burn as they may introduce infection and will need to be removed once the casualty is in hospital. \uf0b7 Apply adhesive tape or dressings as the burn may be larger than it first \uf0b7 Remove clothing that is stuck to the wound, as this will invariably cause more The skeletal system There are 206 bones in the human skeleton, the functions of which are: \uf0b7 To provide support to the body\u2019s soft tissue. This gives the body its shape. \uf0b7 To provide protection for vital organs such as the brain, lungs and spinal cord. \uf0b7 To allow movement by incorporating different types of", "joints and attachment \uf0b7 To produce red blood cells, some white blood cells and platelets within the marrow of bones such as the femur. \uf0b7 To provide a store of minerals and energy, such as calcium and fats. Causes of injury Different types of force can cause injury to the bones, muscles and joints. Damage will result at the location of the force, such as a Damage will result away from the point where the force was applied, for example a fractured collar bone may result from landing on an outstretched arm. Damage will result from torsion force on the bones and muscles, for example a twisted ankle. Violent movement Damage will result from sudden, violent movements, for example a", "knee injury from violently kicking. Damage will result from the bones becoming weak or brittle due to disease or old age. Types of fracture A fracture is a \u2018break in the continuity of the bone\u2019. These are the basic categories for a fracture: A clean break or crack to the bone with no complications arising. A broken bone will break the skin, and may or may not still be protruding from the wound. Please bear in mind that these types of injury carry a high risk of infection. Complicated There are usually complications with this type of fracture, such as trapped blood vessels or nerves. These are more likely to occur in children who have young, more flexible bones. The", "bone splits, but is not completely severed. Green stick fractures can easily be mistaken for sprains and strains as only a few of the signs of fracture are present. A dislocation occurs when a bone becomes partially or completely dislodged at the joint, usually resulting from a wrenching movement or sudden muscular contraction. The most common areas of dislocation are the jaw, thumb, knee cap, shoulder or finger. Fractures can occur at or near the site of a dislocation, along with damage to ligaments, tendons and cartilage. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between a fracture and a dislocation. Never try to manipulate a dislocated joint back into place as this is best left to medical experts, and the process", "can be extremely painful and traumatic to the casualty. Also, you may inadvertently cause further damage. Sprains and strains A sprain is an injury to the ligament at a joint. A strain is an injury to a muscle. These types of injury are usually caused by sudden wrenching which causes the joint to over stretch tearing the surrounding muscles and ligaments. Minor fractures can be easily mistaken for a sprain or a strain. If you have any doubts, treat the injury as if it were a fracture to be on the safe side. The only way you can be sure if it is or is not a fracture is by x-ray. Signs and symptoms of fracture: Pain will occur at", "the site of the fracture. The casualty may have taken strong pain killers, have nerve damage or dementia, so be aware. For example, the casualty will not be able to lift anything with a fractured arm. Unnatural movement If a limb is moving in an unnatural way, it is likely to be an \u2018unstable\u2019 fracture and care should be taken to prevent the fracture from moving and causing further Swelling and bruising This usually occurs around the site of the fracture. If the limb is bent in the wrong place, it is broken. There will be lumps or depressions along the surface of a bone where the broken ends overlap. This is the feeling, or sound, of bone grating on", "bone when the broken ends rub together. This occurs at the site of the injury. Treatment of a basic fracture: \uf0b7 Head injuries (see page 13) \uf0b7 Flail chest (see page 27) \uf0b7 Spinal injuries (see page 55) \uf0b7 Reassure the casualty and tell them not to move. \uf0b7 Use your hands to keep the injury still until it can be immobilised professionally. The casualty may be able to do this on their own, but bear in mind they may be in shock. \uf0b7 Do not move the casualty before the injury is immobilised, unless they are in direct danger (as in the middle of a road). \uf0b7 Do not try to bandage the injury if you have already called", "for an ambulance, just keep it still. If there is an open wound, you may cover it with a sterile dressing while you wait for help. \uf0b7 Do not allow the casualty to eat, drink or smoke, as they may need surgery For injury to an upper limb: \uf0b7 Carefully, and gently place the arm in a sling against the body. It is common to use a support sling for arm fractures. For collar bone fractures, it is common to use an elevated sling (keep the casualty\u2019s elbow down at their side when using an elevated sling for a fractured collar bone). \uf0b7 Should the casualty be in severe pain, circulation or nerves to the arm are affected, the casualty", "is having problems breathing or you are at all unsure dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. \uf0b7 Arrange for the casualty to be transported to hospital. For injury to a lower limb: \uf0b7 Keep the casualty still, and ensure they are kept warm. Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. \uf0b7 If there is any delay to the ambulance reaching you (for example you are in a remote part of the country) immobilise the injury by gently bandaging the injured leg to the uninjured one. \uf0b7 Check that their circulation has not been cut off beyond the injury and bandages. If necessary, loosen the bandages. Treatment of sprains and strains: The best way to treat sprains and strains is to follow", "the RICE mnemonic: Ensure the casualty rests the injury. For example, do not allow a sportsman to continue (remind them it is better to miss one game than the next ten!). As soon as you can, apply an ice pack (frozen vegetables such as peas or, if you have it, a refrigerant gel pack). This helps to reduce swelling and speeds recovery. Be sure not to place the ice pack directly onto the skin, as this can cause frostbite. A tea towel or any sort of thin barrier will suffice. Do this for 10 minutes every 2 hours for 24 hours for maximum effect. Compression Apply a firm (not constricting) bandage to the injured area. This also will help reduce", "the swelling, and provide support. The bandage can be applied over an ice pack for the first ten minutes, but be sure to remove the ice pack after this time. Elevate the injury, as this helps reduce swelling. Please bear in mind that minor fractures can very easily be mistaken for a sprain or strain. The only way to be sure there is no fracture is to send or take the casualty to hospital for an x-ray. Approximately 2% of trauma (injury) casualties suffer spinal injury. Although this percentage appears to be fairly low, suspecting and correctly treating a spinal injury is essential. Poor treatment of a casualty with a suspected spinal injury may result in them being crippled for", "life, or even in death. The spinal cord is an extension of the brain stem, and is located down the back of the spinal vertebrae. The spinal cord houses vital nerves which control breathing and movement. The most vulnerable part of the spinal column is the neck, and a neck injury can often be the most severe type of spinal injury. This is because as mentioned, the nerves controlling breathing are housed here and may become severed. Suspected spinal injury: Always assume the worst if the casualty has: \uf0b7 Received a blow to the head, neck or back (this is especially important if the blow results in a loss of consciousness). \uf0b7 Fallen from a height. For example, from a", "horse, a ladder or off a roof. \uf0b7 Dived into shallow water. \uf0b7 Been involved in a speed accident like a car accident, or been knocked down. \uf0b7 Been in a \u2018cave in\u2019 type accident (e.g. crushing, or a scrum in rugby union). \uf0b7 Multiple injuries. \uf0b7 Any pain or tenderness to the neck or back after being involved in an accident. However, be aware that strong pain killers or other severe injuries may mask the pain that would normally alert you to a spinal injury. \uf0b7 You are in any doubt at all. Remember with this kind of injury it is better to be safe than sorry. Possible signs and symptoms of a spinal injury: Please remember \u2013 if", "any of the signs and symptoms below are present, nerves may already have suffered damage. Always treat a casualty that you suspect of having a spinal injury to prevent the signs and symptoms developing. \uf0b7 Any pain or tenderness in the neck or back. \uf0b7 Any sign of a fracture to the neck or back. \uf0b7 Loss of control or sensation in limbs below the site of the injury. \uf0b7 A feeling of pins and needles, or a burning sensation in the limbs. \uf0b7 Difficulty breathing. Treatment of spinal injury: If the casualty is conscious: \uf0b7 Tell the casualty not to move and keep reassuring them. \uf0b7 Do not allow the casualty to move or be moved, keep them in", "the position you found them in until help arrives. They should only be moved if they are in severe and immediate danger. \uf0b7 It is vitally important to immobilise the casualty\u2019s head. Do this with your hands on either side and try to keep their head and neck in line with the upper \uf0b7 Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. Keep the casualty still and warm until help arrives. If the casualty is unconscious: \uf0b7 Do not move, or allow the casualty to be moved unless they are in severe and immediate danger. \uf0b7 Check their airway and breathing. If they are breathing fine on their own, the airway is clear so there is no need to move the head", "back. However, if need be you can use the \u2018jaw thrust\u2019 technique to keep the airway open without moving the head (this technique is explained on page 58). Keep a close eye on their \uf0b7 Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. \uf0b7 Using your hands, keep their head still and in line with their upper body. \uf0b7 If for any reason you have to leave the casualty, if they begin to vomit or if you have concerns about their airway at all, place the casualty in the recovery position. Make sure you keep the head, neck and upper body in line when you turn the casualty. To do this effectively, you will inevitably need more than one rescuer, so get", "local help if you can (see page 55 for instructions on how to place a suspected spinal injury casualty in the recovery position). \uf0b7 Keep the casualty still and warm. Keep a close eye on the airway and breathing until help arrives. If the casualty is not breathing normally: \uf0b7 If the casualty is having trouble breathing the airway will need to be opened. The head tilt may be used, but the tilt should be kept to a minimum to allow unobstructed rescue breaths to be administered. \uf0b7 Only if you are trained and confident, you can try to use the \u2018jaw thrust\u2019 technique. If this does not work and the casualty is still not breathing normally, you should open", "the airway using the head tilt method before carrying out resuscitation. \uf0b7 Check their breathing once the airway has been opened. \uf0b7 If this does not help and the casualty is still having problems breathing dial 999 for an ambulance immediately, then carry out resuscitation. \uf0b7 Try to obtain the help of others; they can support the head while you perform Remember \u2013 if the resuscitation results in paralysis from a neck injury it is a tragedy, but failing to maintain an open airway will result in death. Managing the airway with a spinal injury casualty If an unconscious casualty is laid on their back, the airway is in danger of becoming blocked by vomit or their tongue sliding back.", "An uninjured but unconscious casualty can simply be turned into the recovery position to help protect the airway. However, if a spinal injury is suspected, you must take great care not to move the spine. If the casualty is already lying on their side (not on their backs) you may not need to move them at all. Check that the airway is not in danger of becoming blocked by vomit or their tongue. If not, keep the casualty in the position you Try to monitor the casualty\u2019s breathing, if it is normal you may be able to keep them still until the ambulance arrives, even if the casualty is on their back. However, should the tongue slide back or the", "casualty vomit then immediate action is required to keep their airway clear. If the casualty is breathing, but the tongue is starting to slide back and obstruct the airway (the casualty starts making a snoring sound when they breathe) then the jaw thrust technique can be employed to keep the airway open: \uf0b7 Kneel at the casualty\u2019s head, knees apart to keep your balance. \uf0b7 Rest your elbows on your legs (or the floor) for support and hold the casualty\u2019s head with your hands, keeping their head and neck in line with the body. \uf0b7 Place your middle and index fingers under their jaw line (under the ears). \uf0b7 Keeping their head still, lift the jaw upwards with your fingers.", "This action gently lifts the tongue away from the back of the throat keeping the airway Do not attempt the jaw thrust technique during CPR \u2013 tilt their head back instead to open the airway. If you have to leave the casualty for any reason, if they begin to vomit or you are at all concerned about their airway being clear, the casualty will have to be put on their side. Always remember to keep the head, neck and upper body in line when you turn the casualty. The most effective method of turning a casualty with a suspected spinal injury is the log roll technique. However, you will need at least three helpers to perform this on the casualty:", "\uf0b7 Supporting the head of the casualty, keep the head, neck and upper body in \uf0b7 The helpers should kneel along one side of the casualty. Ask them to gently straighten the casualty\u2019s arms and legs. \uf0b7 Ensuring that you all work together, ask the helpers to roll the casualty towards them on your count of three. You should gently move the head in time with the body as the helpers roll the casualty onto their side. \uf0b7 Make sure you keep the head, neck, body and legs in line the whole time. If you can, keep the casualty in this position until the ambulance arrives. Recovery position: In the event that you have to turn a casualty onto their", "side to protect their airway, but you are on your own, you will have to use the recovery position method. Keep the head, neck and body in line to the best of your ability as you roll the casualty onto their side.

The helper(s) should pull equally on the casualty\u2019s far leg and shoulder as they turn the casualty, keeping the spine in line. You need to gently move the head to keep it in line with the upper body as the casualty is Effects of heat and cold This part of the notes deals with the effects of over exposure to both heat and cold on the body. Severe Hypothermia or Heat Stroke can be potentially fatal conditions and require skilful treatment from the first aider. Those who are most at risk from these conditions are", "babies, children, the elderly or infirm and people who take part in outdoor activities like hiking, sailing or running a marathon. Body temperature The ideal temperature for the body to work at is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). The temperature is maintained by an area of the brain known as the \u2018hypothalamus\u2019. If the body should become too hot we start to sweat, which evaporates from the skin cooling it down. Blood vessels near the surface of the skin dilate (which causes skin to flush) and the cooled blood is then circulated around the body. If the body should become too cold we start to shiver, which creates heat from our muscles moving. Blood vessels near the surface of the skin constrict (which", "causes skin to appear pale), keeping the blood closer to the warmer core of the body. The hair on the skin stands up, trapping warm air (better known as goose Injuries that result from exposure to extremes of temperature can be \u2018localised\u2019 (for example sunburn and frostbite), or \u2018generalised\u2019 (for example hypothermia and heat stroke). Signs and symptoms of changes to body temperature: The symptoms of over-exposure to heat or cold can be seen in the table below. As the body\u2019s temperature rises and becomes too hot or drops and becomes too cold, the hypothalamus stops working, and the condition rapidly deteriorates as the body stops fighting the condition. 109.4-104\u00b0F / 43-40\u00b0C Unconsciousness / fitting. Confused / restless. Headache, dizzy,", "uncomfortable. Strong, pounding pulse. Flushed, dry skin, hot to the touch. 104-100.4\u00b0F / 40-38\u00b0C Cramps in stomach / arms / legs. Pale, sweaty skin. Nausea / loss of appetite. 100.4-96.8\u00b0F / 38-36\u00b0C Normal body temperature. 96.8-89.6\u00b0F / 36-32\u00b0C Mild hypothermia Fatigue, slurred speech. Confusion, forgetfulness. Shivering stops, muscle rigidity. Very slow, very weak pulse. Noticeable drowsiness. 87.8-75.2\u00b0F / 31-24\u00b0C Severe hypothermia Severe reduction in response levels. Unconsciousness. Pulse undetectable. Appearance of death. Hypothermia will occur when the core temperature of the body falls below 35\u00b0C. If the casualty is suffering from the mildest form of hypothermia, they will usually make a full recovery with professional treatment. Should the casualty\u2019s core body temperature fall below 26\u00b0C, it will most likely be", "fatal. However, there have been cases of successful resuscitation of casualties with body temperatures of as low as 10\u00b0C, so it\u2019s always worth the attempt. The usual cause of hypothermia is over exposure to cold temperatures, but the different types of casualty and condition may have an effect on the risk: \uf0b7 The hypothalamus of a baby or young child is underdeveloped, which can lead to hypothermia from as little as a cold room. \uf0b7 The elderly or infirm tend not to generate as much body heat so any prolonged time in the cold will lower their core temperature. \uf0b7 Wet clothes or submersion in cold water results in the body cooling much faster than when dry, as water conducts", "heat away from the body. \uf0b7 Inadequate clothing in windy weather will result in cold air in continuous contact with skin, resulting in the body cooling faster. Signs and symptoms: \uf0b7 Skin appears pale and cold to the touch. \uf0b7 Initial shivering, with the body stiffening as the body cools further. \uf0b7 Bodily functions slow, including pulse, speech, breathing and thought. \uf0b7 Appears to be drunk \u2013 lethargic, confused, disorientated. \uf0b7 Lowered levels of response leading to unconsciousness and finally death. Treatment of hypothermia: If the casualty is unconscious: \uf0b7 Clear the airway and check the casualty is breathing. If not, commence CPR. \uf0b7 Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. \uf0b7 If the casualty is breathing, carefully place them in", "the recovery position. Do not move the casualty unnecessarily as the slightest jolt may cause the heart to \uf0b7 Place insulating materials, such as blankets, under and around the casualty making sure to cover the head. \uf0b7 Remember to monitor the casualty\u2019s breathing. Their pulse may be hard to locate, but it is safe to assume the casualty\u2019s heart is beating if they are If the casualty is conscious: \uf0b7 Try to get the casualty to shelter if possible, remove any wet clothing and replace with dry, warm clothing. Cover the head, as a lot of heat is lost here. \uf0b7 If the casualty is young, fit and able then ask them to get into a warm bath (40\u00b0C /", "104\u00b0F). Do not allow an elderly casualty to do this. \uf0b7 If the option of a bath is not viable, wrap them in warm blankets, heat the room to a warm temperature (25\u00b0C / 77\u00b0F). \uf0b7 If the casualty is outdoors, try to insulate them from the environment as much as possible. Use a survival bag and shelter if you have them. Also share your body heat with them. \uf0b7 Give the casualty something warm to drink and eat. \uf0b7 Seek medical advice if the casualty is a child, elderly or you are unsure about their condition. \uf0b7 If their condition appears severe, dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. It is vital to NEVER: \uf0b7 Give the casualty alcohol, as", "it dilates blood vessels which will cool the casualty further. \uf0b7 Place a heat source directly on or near the casualty, this will draw the blood to the skin causing the blood pressure to fall and place stress on the heart. \uf0b7 Try to warm a baby or elderly person quickly by placing them in a warm bath. A hypothermia casualty\u2019s heart is in grave danger of \u2018ventricular fibrillation\u2019, which causes cardiac arrest. Always handle a hypothermic casualty with care as the slightest jolt can induce the condition. This condition usually affects the extremities (such as fingers, toes, ears, etc.) when they are exposed to cold. The cells become frozen, causing ice crystals to form in the cells which in", "turn cause them to rupture and die. Frostbite can often be accompanied by hypothermia, which also needs to be treated. Severe frostbite can result in the loss of the affected area, normally fingers and toes. Signs and symptoms: \uf0b7 Pins and needles, numbness. \uf0b7 Skin hardens and stiffens. \uf0b7 Skin colour changes \u2013 firstly white, then blue tinge and eventually black. \uf0b7 Once recovered, the affected area will be hot, red, blistered and extremely Treatment of frostbite: \uf0b7 Carefully remove any rings, watches, bracelets, etc. \uf0b7 Try to stop the freezing getting worse if the casualty is outdoors by placing the limb under their arm or holding it in your hands. \uf0b7 Do not rub the affected area as this", "will cause damage. \uf0b7 Do not try to re-warm the affected area if there is a chance of it refreezing. Move the casualty indoors before you attempt to treat them. \uf0b7 Place the affected area in warm water. Be sure to test the water yourself first, use your elbow as you would for a baby\u2019s bath. \uf0b7 If the casualty is an adult, they may take up to two paracetamol tablets (providing they are not allergic) for intense pain. \uf0b7 Arrange transport for the casualty to hospital as soon as possible. This condition is the body responding to loss of water and salt through excessive sweating. The most common cause of heat exhaustion is working or exercising in a hot", "temperature (such as marathon runners). Signs and symptoms: \uf0b7 Confusion and dizziness. \uf0b7 Pale, sweaty skin. \uf0b7 Nausea, loss of appetite and vomiting. \uf0b7 Fast, weak pulse and breathing. \uf0b7 Cramping in the arms, legs and abdomen. \uf0b7 The casualty may complain of being cold, but will be hot to the touch. Treatment of heat exhaustion: \uf0b7 Remove the casualty to a cool area. \uf0b7 Remove any excessive clothing and get them to lie down. \uf0b7 Give the casualty plenty of water, or preferably some form of oral re-hydration such as \u2018Diaoralyte\u2019 or isotonic drinks as this replaces their lost salt too. \uf0b7 Get medical advice, even if the casualty quickly recovers. \uf0b7 If the casualty\u2019s response levels deteriorate, place", "them in the recovery position and dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. Monitor the casualty\u2019s airway and breathing. \uf0b7 Treat the casualty for heat stroke if necessary. This is a very serious condition which results from the hypothalamus failing (the temperature control centre) in the brain. The sweating mechanism fails resulting in the body being unable to cool down and the core temperature reaching a dangerously high level (over 40\u00b0C) in a relatively short time (around 10 to 15 minutes). Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to heat or a high fever, and usually follows heat exhaustion. Signs and symptoms: \uf0b7 Severe confusion, restlessness. \uf0b7 Flushed, dry hot skin, no sweating. \uf0b7 Strong, fast pulse. \uf0b7 Throbbing headache.", "\uf0b7 Nausea and vomiting. \uf0b7 Response levels reduced, leading to unconsciousness. \uf0b7 Possible seizures if casualty is unconscious. Treatment of heat stroke: \uf0b7 Move the casualty to an area that is cool and shaded. \uf0b7 Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. \uf0b7 Use whatever methods you can to cool the casualty as quickly as possible. Remove outer clothes, wrap the casualty in a cool, wet sheet. Keep the sheet wet and cold until the casualty\u2019s temperature returns to a normal level, then remove and replace with a dry sheet. \uf0b7 Other ways to cool the casualty can include continual sponging with cold water, fanning the casualty to help the water evaporate (as would normally happen with sweat), place the casualty", "in a cool shower if they are conscious and able to stand, spray with water (such as with a garden hose). \uf0b7 If the casualty has a seizure, treat them as you would for a febrile convulsion Taking a temperature There are modern, easy to use thermometers available now, such as disposable strips that you place on the forehead, and digital thermometers. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions on how to use them. If, however, you have an old fashioned mercury thermometer, the following advice may be helpful: \uf0b7 Be careful when using the thermometer as the mercury inside is poisonous. \uf0b7 Make sure it is thoroughly cleaned before use. \uf0b7 Hold it by the end opposite to the silver, mercury bulb.", "\uf0b7 Shake the thermometer until the mercury falls below the 35\u00b0C mark. \uf0b7 Place it under the tongue of a conscious adult, or in the armpit of a child. \uf0b7 Keep it in place for at 3 minutes. \uf0b7 The level the mercury rises to will indicate the casualty\u2019s temperature. This condition occurs when the casualty does not produce enough of the hormone insulin naturally. The body uses insulin to break down the sugar that we digest, so that it can be used by the cells or stored for later use. Basically, insulin reduces the amount of sugar in the blood. Should diabetes go untreated, the casualty\u2019s blood sugar levels will rise dangerously over 1 or 2 days (this depends", "on the severity of their condition). Diabetes is split into three different types, which are categorised by the treatment used to control it: The person still produces insulin naturally, so they can control the levels of sugar in their blood through what they Tablet controlled The person still produces a small amount of insulin naturally, but rely on tablets to control the amount of sugar in their blood. This is usually in conjunction with a controlled diet. Insulin dependent The person produces little or no insulin naturally and has to administer insulin by injection twice or more a day. This helps keep the sugar levels in their blood under control. High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) This occurs when the diabetes is", "not treated effectively with any of the methods mentioned above. The sugar levels in the blood climb and acids build up. The signs and symptoms displayed by a hyperglycaemic person are a result of the body trying to excrete the acid build up. Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) This condition occurs mainly with diabetic people who are insulin dependent, as the level of insulin in the body is \u2018fixed\u2019 due to the dose administered by Because the amount of insulin is fixed, they must balance it with the amount of Blood sugar levels fall if: \uf0b7 The person has not eaten enough food. \uf0b7 The person over exerts (burns off the sugar in their blood). \uf0b7 The person has injected a", "too high dose of insulin. Why low blood sugar is dangerous: Unlike the other cells in the body, glucose (sugar) is the only energy source the brain can use. If the sugar in the blood drops, this literally starves the brain. Please refer to the table below for signs and symptoms of both low and high blood sugar. The result is the \u2018hungry\u2019 brain cells become disordered, causing the release of adrenaline into the body (see \u2018the body\u2019s response to hypoxia\u2019, see Signs and symptoms: High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) Slow \u2013 12 to 48 hours Fast \u2013 2 mins to 1 hour Deterioration is slow during onset: \uf0b7 Drowsy, lethargic. \uf0b7 Unconsciousness if left untreated.

Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. Treatment of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia): If the casualty is conscious: \uf0b7 Sit the casualty in a comfortable position. \uf0b7 Give the casualty a sugary drink", "(isotonic sports drinks are the best option as they are high in sugar), sugar lumps, glucose tablets, chocolate or other sweet \uf0b7 If the casualty responds quickly to this treatment, wait five minutes then give them some carbohydrates (a sandwich, pasta, etc.). \uf0b7 Stay with the casualty, do not leave them alone. Let them rest until they are fully alert and their response levels are back to normal. \uf0b7 Suggest to the casualty they see their doctor, even if they appear to have fully \uf0b7 If the casualty does not respond to the treatment within 10 minutes, or they become unmanageable, dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. \uf0b7 Consider the possibility that there may be another cause for the casualty\u2019s", "If the casualty is unconscious: \uf0b7 Open the airway and check for breath. Resuscitate if necessary. \uf0b7 Place the casualty in the recovery position if they are breathing normally. \uf0b7 Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately. People with this condition have a tendency to have seizures (fits) that come from a disturbance in the brain. However, bear in mind that one in twenty people will experience a seizure at some point in their lives, so the casualty may not be epileptic. The causes of a seizure are many, such as hypoxia, stroke, a head injury or even a high body temperature. Seizures are common in babies and children whose temperature is too high due to illness and fever. This is", "covered under the heading \u2018febrile convulsions\u2019, This condition is also known as \u2018absence seizures\u2019 or \u2018petit mal\u2019 seizures. The person may suddenly appear to be daydreaming (even in mid-sentence). This may only last a couple of seconds before recovery, and the person may not even realise what just happened. On some occasions a minor seizure may be accompanied by unusual movements such as twitching in the face, jerking of a limb or lip smacking. The person can at times make a noise such as a sudden Treatment of minor seizures: \uf0b7 Remove any danger near the casualty, such as cutlery or hot drinks they may \uf0b7 Help the casualty to sit in a quiet place, and reassure them. \uf0b7 Stay", "with them until they are fully alert. \uf0b7 If the casualty is unaware of any condition, suggest they see their doctor. This is the more serious type of seizure, resulting from a major disturbance in the brain which causes aggressive fitting throughout the body. These types of fit can be very frightening to see, but try to remain calm as prompt action is essential for the casualty. Signs and symptoms: There is usually a pattern to a major seizure. If the casualty has had a history of seizures, they may recognise when a fit is imminent. The warning signs (or aura) could include a taste in the mouth, a smell or a peculiar feeling. This warning may give them sufficient", "time to seek help or simply find somewhere quiet to lie down before they This phase is where every muscle in the body goes rigid. The casualty may emit a cry and fall to the floor. Their back may arch and their lips may turn blue (cyanosis). This typically lasts less than 20 seconds. \u2018Clonic\u2019 phase The casualty\u2019s limbs make sudden, violent jerking movements, their eyes may roll, they may clench their teeth, they may drool from the mouth (sometimes it can be bloody due to biting their tongue) and there could be a \u2018snoring\u2019 sound when they breathe. Also, the casualty may lose control of their bladder and/or bowel. The clonic phase can last from 30 seconds to hours,", "but most stop within a couple of minutes. If the seizure lasts more than 15 minutes, or they have a number of consecutive seizures, it is a dire medical emergency and should be treated as such. Recovery phase This is when the body relaxes even though the casualty may still be unresponsive. Their response levels will improve within a few minutes, but they may not be fully alert for about 20 minutes or so. They may want to sleep to recuperate, and be unaware of their actions. Treatment of major seizures (fits): During the seizure: \uf0b7 If you can, help the casualty to the floor to avoid injury. \uf0b7 Try to cushion the casualty\u2019s head, to avoid head trauma. This", "can be accomplished with a folded coat, jumper or even your hands. \uf0b7 Loosen any tight clothing around their neck to help them breathe. \uf0b7 Try to move any objects from the area around the casualty, to lessen the risk of them hurting themselves, and ask bystanders to move away if necessary. \uf0b7 If you have any concerns about their airway, roll them onto their side. \uf0b7 Take an exact note of the time the seizure started and how long it lasts. \uf0b7 If the casualty is a stranger to you, check for any identification. Dial 999 for an ambulance if: \uf0b7 The seizure lasts for more than 3 minutes. \uf0b7 Once the seizure has run its course, if their", "response levels don\u2019t improve within 10 minutes. \uf0b7 The casualty has a second seizure. \uf0b7 If the casualty has no history of epilepsy, or this is their first major seizure. \uf0b7 You do not know the casualty. \uf0b7 You are at all unsure. As soon as the seizure stops: \uf0b7 Check the casualty\u2019s airway and breathing. Resuscitate if necessary. \uf0b7 Place the casualty in the recovery position. \uf0b7 Try to keep the casualty warm (unless a high temperature caused the seizure initially) and reassure them. \uf0b7 Monitor their airway and breathing. \uf0b7 Move any bystanders away before the casualty comes to, and try to preserve \uf0b7 Keep a close eye on their response levels and dial 999 for an ambulance", "if their condition doesn\u2019t improve within 10 minutes, or if you are unsure at all.

When the child is in the \u2018tonic\u2019 phase, s/he may stop breathing as the diaphragm goes rigid resulting in the lips and face turning blue (cyanosis). It is vital, therefore, to remain as calm and reassuring as possible in this situation. The child may have", "been unwell recently and be hot to the touch.

Health & Safety (first aid) Regulations 1981 Employer\u2019s responsibility: It is the responsibility of the employer to make sure sufficient first aid provision is made in the workplace, under Health & Safety law. This includes: \uf0b7 Assessing the first aid needs of the workplace \u2013 how many first aiders are needed, what type of training is required, are they following the guidance from the", "HSE (Health & Safety Executive). \uf0b7 Provide training and re-qualification courses for the appointed first aiders. \uf0b7 Ensure there are enough first aid kits and equipment for the workplace, and that they are well stocked. \uf0b7 Ensure that all staff are aware who the first aiders are and where to find them should they need treatment. Following is advice for employers on their responsibilities, but first aid training organisations are usually happy to give further advice if needed. The first aid kit should be easily accessible; preferably near somewhere the first aider can wash their hands. The kits should be easily identified by a large white cross on a green background. The container should protect the contents from First aid", "kits should be available at all workplaces. However, larger sites will need more than one first aid kit to cover the greater amount of people. The kits should contain the following, as a guide only: \uf0b7 A leaflet with general guidance on first aid. \uf0b7 20 individually wrapped sticking plasters of assorted sizes and absorption, suited to the type of work (e.g., blue plasters are to be used by food handlers, as they are highly visible). Hypoallergenic plasters can be provided too. \uf0b7 2 sterile eye pads. \uf0b7 4 individually wrapped triangular bandages, preferably sterile. \uf0b7 6 safety pins. \uf0b7 6 individually wrapped medium, sterile wound dressings (approx. 12cm x \uf0b7 2 individually wrapped large, sterile wound dressings (approx. 18cm", "x 18cm). \uf0b7 1 pair of disposable gloves. Please remember some people are allergic to latex, so try to find an alternative (such as Nitrile). The above contents are not mandatory and equivalent items can be used. You can also add items such as scissors, adhesive tape, disposable aprons, individually wrapped moist wipes, face shields, etc. Keep them in the first aid kit, if there is room, or nearby if not. You may also wish to consider keeping other equipment close to the first aid kit such as blankets (to help protect casualties from the elements, keep them warm if they are in shock, etc.), breathing apparatus (should the first aider need to enter a dangerous atmosphere), etc. If there", "is no access to tap water for eye irrigation, there should be at least 1 litre of sterile water, or \u2018saline\u2019 solution available in a sealed, disposable Travelling first aid kits If the employees travel, it is advisable to provide them with a first aid kit, which will typically include: \uf0b7 A leaflet with general guidance on first aid. \uf0b7 6 individually wrapped sterile plasters. \uf0b7 2 individually wrapped triangular bandages, preferably sterile. \uf0b7 2 safety pins. \uf0b7 1 individually wrapped large, sterile wound dressing (approx. 18cm x 18cm). \uf0b7 Individually wrapped moist cleansing wipes. \uf0b7 1 pair of disposable gloves.

Workplace hazards and risks One of the more difficult areas of a first aid needs assessment is taking into consideration the nature of the work and workplace hazards and risks. Employers should take into consideration the risks and identify the possible injuries which could occur in order to ensure the first aid provision is sufficient. The table below, compiled using information from the HSE, should help in identifying some common workplace risks, and the possible resulting injuries: Possible injuries Fracture, laceration, strain and sprain Slip / Trip Hazard Fracture, laceration, strain and sprain Crush injury, amputation, fracture, eye injury, laceration Head injury,", "unconsciousness, spinal injury, fracture, strain and sprain Workplace Transport Crush injury, fracture, spinal injury, strain and sprain Electric shock, burns Poison, unconsciousness, burns, eye injury All these aspects should be taken into consideration by the employer to determine how many people should be trained in first aid, and to what level to ensure their workplace is safely covered. An employer should consider a number of things when choosing an employee to be a first aider. Ideally, a first aider will have the following: \uf0b7 Reliability, good disposition and communication skills \uf0b7 An aptitude and ability to absorb new skills and knowledge \uf0b7 An ability to cope with stressful and physically demanding emergency \uf0b7 Normal workplace duties that can be left", "if an emergency situation arises As of October 2009, there have been introduced a new training regime for first aiders.

Annual refresher training The HSE recommend that all employees trained in first aid attend an annual refresher course due to the evidence on the severity of \u2018first aid skill fade\u2019. The above flow chart shows the HSE\u2019s recommended sequence of training. Reporting incidents at work All accidents in the workplace must be recorded in an accident book, no matter how small the resulting injury. The incident may need to be reported to the HSE under RIDDOR RIDDOR 1995 regulations Reporting of Injuries,", "Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995. These regulations specify that it is the responsibility of the employer or person in control of the premises to report the following incidents directly to the HSE: \uf0b7 Death (report immediately) \uf0b7 Major injury (report immediately) \uf0b7 Dangerous occurrences (report immediately) \uf0b7 Incident resulting in a person being off work (or unable to carry out full duties) for more than 3 days (report within 10 days) \uf0b7 Diseases (report asap) For further information, please visit the RIDDOR website at www.riddor.gov.uk.

It is worth noting that a heart attack does not always result in cardiac arrest. The majority of heart attack victims remain conscious and survive. If a heart attack, or another cause, results in cardiac arrest, it is usually because it has interrupted the heart\u2019s electrical impulses. When this happens the heart \u2018quivers\u2019 chaotically instead of beating in the usual co-ordinated rhythm. This is known as \u2018Ventricular Fibrillation\u2019 (VF). Normal Sinus Rhythm Ventricular Fibrillation The definitive treatment for ventricular fibrillation is to administer a controlled electric shock to the heart, which stops the \u2018quiver\u2019 and enables it to", "start beating normally again. This treatment is called \u2018defibrillation\u2019. An Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is a safe and reliable computerised device that analyses the heart rhythms and enables a non-medically qualified person to safely administer the life-saving shock, with some small amount of training. Using an AED can drastically increase the chances of a casualty\u2019s survival if their heart stops beating, but prompt use is paramount.

Also be sure to dry the area of the chest between the pads, as electricity can \u2018arc\u2019 across the wet skin. Excessive chest hair Hair on the chest will stop the pads from sticking to the skin properly and will interfere with electrical contact. You only need to shave the chest if the hair is excessive, and even then take", "as little time as possible as you don\u2019t want to delay defibrillation by any longer than is absolutely necessary. If there is no razor immediately available, do not delay defibrillation. Research shows that the position of the pad on the lower left side of the chest has an impact on the effectiveness of the shock. When placing the pad, make sure it is placed around the side of the chest (not on the front) and place it vertically. This will help ensure the maximum electricity flows through the heart rather than across the surface of the chest. If the AED has not been updated, the pads will have a diagram showing horizontal placement \u2013 ignore this advice and place the", "pad vertically. AED safety considerations: Studies have shown that, providing the pads are stuck to a dry chest in the correct positions, the risk of electrical shock is very low as the electricity wants to travel from one pad to the other, not to \u2018earth\u2019 itself like mains electricity. However, to be on the safe side, always briefly check that no one is touching the casualty before a shock is delivered. DO NOT delay defibrillation because the casualty is lying on a wet or metal surface, providing the chest area is dry it is safe to administer the shock. Medication patches Some casualties will wear a patch to administer their medication (e.g. a nicotine patch). Some heart patients wear a", "\u2018glyceryl tri-nitrate\u2019 (GTN) patch. Please be aware that this type of patch can explode if electricity is passed through it. Remove any visible medication patches before administering a shock as a precaution. Be aware when placing the pads that you do not place them on any jewellery, such as a necklace. This would conduct the electricity and burn the casualty. There is no need to remove any piercings, but avoid placing the pads over any. Implanted devices Some heart patients have pacemakers or defibrillator implants. These can usually be seen or felt under the skin when the chest is exposed, there may also be a scar. The implants are usually situated just below the left collar bone and should not", "be in the way of the AED pad. However, if the device has been implanted elsewhere, try not to place the pad directly over it. Highly flammable atmosphere As with any electrical equipment, there is a possibility of the AED creating a spark when the shock is administered, so it should not be used in a highly flammable atmosphere (in the presence of a gas leak for example). Inappropriate shock AED machines have been proven to analyse the heart\u2019s rhythm extremely accurately. However, the casualty needs to be motionless while the AED does the analysis. You must not use an AED on a casualty who is fitting (violent, jerking movements), and ensure vehicle engines or vibrating machines are switched off", "wherever possible. AED use on children: The AED pads are suitable for both adults and children older than 8 years. Smaller pads that reduce the current delivered in a shock are available for children aged 1 to 8 years. These should be used for the appropriate age range whenever possible. Some AEDs have a \u2018paediatric\u2019 setting. If the child is over 1 year and you do not have smaller pads, use the AED as it is. But please note that the use of adult sized pads on a child under 1 year old is not recommended. Most paediatric pads are designed to be placed with one in the centre of the child\u2019s chest and the other in the centre of", "the child\u2019s back. The pads should have a diagram showing their correct positions. Some paediatric pads are designed to be placed in the same position as the adult pads \u2013 always follow the diagrams on the pads to ensure you are placing them in the correct place. the area between the lowest ribs and the pelvis Hormone secreted by the body in times of shock the passage from the mouth and nose to the lungs minute air sacks in the lungs, through which the exchange of gasses take place deficiency of oxygen caused by an interruption in the passage of air to the lungs top, \u2018collecting\u2019 chamber of the heart (of which there are two) person under 1 year old", "inspiration and expiration of air into and out of the lungs small air passages in the lungs, leading to the alveoli Cardiac / cardiogenic concerned with the heart smallest structural living unit of an organism Cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, to cushion it and provide nutrients the largest part of the brain concerned with the neck person between 1 year old and puberty the movement of blood around the body bleeding or swelling in the cranial cavity, exerting pressure on shaking of the brain, causing temporary loss of consciousness or alertness, \u2018normal\u2019 activity of the brain to close down, become narrower Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation, manually squeezing the heart and breathing for a casualty the", "cavity in the skull in which the brain lies blue/grey tinges to the skin, especially the lips, due to lack of the delivery of a large electric shock to the chest in an attempt to re-start the heart become wider, open up substance that enables a biological reaction to happen protective mask with a one-way valve for performing mouth-to- mouth rescue breaths relating to fever or high body temperature bleeding into the pleural cavity of the lungs relating to the liver area of the brain that controls the body\u2019s temperature low volume of blood, a type of shock low levels of oxygen in the blood hormone secreted by the pancreas that enables the usage and storage of sugar manoeuvre to", "open the airway without moving the head, by thrusting the jaw forwards relating to an area of the intestines concerned with the brain and nervous system supply of oxygen and nutrients, and the removal of waste gases a two layered membrane surrounding the lungs, between which is a \u2018serous\u2019 fluid air entry into the pleural cavity of the lung concerned with the lungs vomiting, being sick blowing air into the casualty\u2019s lungs, sufficient to make the fit or convulsion inadequate supply of oxygen to the tissues as a result of a fall in blood pressure or volume group of nerves which emanate from the brain and pass down the spinal column the column of vertebrae which form the back bleed", "or blockage of a blood vessel within the brain the feelings of a casualty e.g. \u2018I feel sick\u2019 Tension pneumothorax air entry into the pleural cavity of the lung that has become pressurised, impairing the function of the good lung and the the area within the rib cage containing the lungs a tight band placed around a limb which was used to stop blood flow, no longer used in first aid lower, larger \u2018pumping\u2019 chamber of the heart (of which there Ventricular Fibrillation quivering, vibrating movements of the ventricles of the heart, producing no effective pumping action", "12.1 Introduction We all observe that when individuals fall ill or are injured, they are taken to hospitals or doctors for treatment. But it takes time to reach them, during which if some initial care is taken, it helps treatment of such individuals and in many cases saves their lives. We also observe that some of the minor illnesses or injuries are cured by taking such initial care. However, this care cannot be taken unless we are aware and trained in first-aid. In the present lesson we shall discuss various aspects of first aid and safety. 12.2 What Does First Aid Mean? First aid is the provision of initial care for an illness or injury. It is usually performed by", "a non-expert person to a sick or injured person until appropriate medical treatment can be accessed in a hospital or by going to a doctor. Certain self- limiting illnesses or minor injuries may not require further medical care after the first aid intervention. It generally consists of a series of simple and in some cases, potentially life-saving techniques that an individual can be trained to perform with minimal equipment. The First aid training, therefore, is of value in both preventing and treating sudden illness or accidental injury and in caring for large number of persons caught in a natural disaster. It is a measure both for self help as well as for the help of others. 12.2.1 Self-help If you,", "as a first-aider, are prepared to help others, you are better able to care for yourself in case of injury or sudden illness. Even if your own condition keeps you from caring for yourself, you can direct others in carrying out correct procedures to follow on your behalf. 12.2.2 Help for Others Having studied first-aid, you are prepared to give others some instruction in first-aid, to promote among them a reasonable safety attitude and to assist them wisely if they are stricken. There is always an obligation on a humanitarian basis to assist the sick and the helpless. There is no greater satisfaction than that resulting from relieving suffering or saving a life.

Health and Physical Education \u2014 Class IX 12.3 Why First Aid? The main objective of first aid is not to cure, but to ensure safety until the patient or affected person accesses specialised treatment. It is the initial assistance or care of a suddenly sick or injured person. It is the care administered by a person as soon as possible after an illness or accident. It", "is this prompt care and attention prior to the arrival of the ambulance that sometimes creates the difference between life and death, or between a full or partial recovery. As shown in Box 12.1, the major objectives of first aid are: (i) to ensure that the victim reaches the place of specialised treatment safely and life is not lost in-between; (ii) to prevent further harm, i.e., the injury that has taken place, does not deteriorate further; (iii) to prevent the danger of further injury; and (iv) to promote recovery, i.e., necessary intervening care is taken in a way that promotes recovery and relieves the victim of pain and uneasiness. 12.4 First Aid in Different Cases It is essential to know", "and be trained in the art of providing first aid. Though it is done by non-expert persons, it cannot and should not be administered without acquiring adequate knowledge and appropriate skill. There are different ways of providing first aid in different cases of accidents and illnesses. Let us take some specific cases and know how first aid is 12.4.1 First aid for Drowning Many deaths occur because of drowning. Death by drowning occurs when air cannot get into the lungs because of the entrance of a small amount of water into the lungs. This may cause the contraction of the throat. In such cases efforts are made to remove water from the stomach of the drowned person. Attempting to forcefully", "remove water from the victim\u2019s stomach should be avoided as this may make the victim vomit and there are chances of casualty. A casualty from drowning needs to be treated by a medical doctor, even if he/she seems to recover, because, as explained in Box 12.2, a secondary drowning may occur in him/her at a later stage. In this particular situation, the aim of the first aid is to restore breathing, to keep the person warm and to arrange for taking him/her to hospital. The following steps may be taken: The basic objectives of First Aid are: \u2022 to give immediate care. \u2022 to protect the casualty from \u2022 to relieve pain. \u2022 to promote recovery. The recovery is promoted", "as the heart rate goes down, which in turn prevents blood loss from the victim\u2019s body. Water entering the lungs causes them to be irritated, and the air passages to swell several hours later\u00ad\u2014a condition known as secondary First Aid and Safety Fig. 12.2 : Steps for CPR in the case of drowning Step 1: Rescue the person and get him/her to the dry land. Keep the person\u2019s head lower than the rest of the body to reduce the risk of inhaling Step 2: Lay down the person on his/her back. Open the airway and check breathing. If required, give CPR (Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation) with chest compression. Step 3: Treat the person for Hypothermia (low body temperature). Remove wet clothes", "and cover him/her with dry blanket. If the person regains full consciousness, give him/her a Step 4: Call for a doctor or ambulance to transport the person to the nearest hospital as soon as possible, even if she/he appears to have recovered fully. 12.4.2 First aid for Fire Injuries When the skin comes in direct contact with fire, it gets damaged. This is known as dry burn. The burn exposes the under lying part of the skin, which increases the chances of infection. While assessing the burn, it is \u2022 consider the circumstances in which the burn \u2022 establish the cause of the burn; \u2022 observe the condition of the victim; does she/he need immediate medical attention? \u2022 assess the", "extent of burn or the depth of the \u2022 determine the degree of risk for infection. Based on the depth of the skin damage, the burns are categorised into three types. Warning \u2013 Water in the lungs can breathes and chest compressions, so these have to be done at a slower rate. Hypothermia develops when the body temperature falls bellow 35\u00b0 Celsius. The effects vary depending on the speed of onset and the level to which the body temperature falls. The students should be encouraged to ask questions if they have any doubt on the procedure of the first aid in swimming. If the swimming facility is available then the life saving technique of drowning can best be practised by", "doing. In the classroom or physical education laboratory the students may make use of dummies. Health and Physical Education \u2014 Class IX \u2022 A superficial burn involves only burns on the outer most layer of the skin, called the epidermis. \u2022 A partial thickness burn is generally very painful, this destroys the epidermis. If such wounds are on more than 20 per cent of the body, then it may be fatal. \u2022 A full thickness burn is not painful in most of the cases, so it may mislead the first\u2011aider and the casualty about the severity of the injury. This needs immediate medical As, the kind of the burns vary, so does the kind of first aid needed for various", "kind of burns. (a) First Aid for Severe Burns In this case, the first aid is given to : \u2022 stop burning and relieve pain; \u2022 treat the associate injuries; \u2022 minimise the risk of infection; In case of severe burn the following steps need to be taken. Step 1: Help the casualty to lie down. Do not allow the injury area to come into direct contact with the ground. Step 2: Pour cold water on the burn for a minimum of 10 minutes, but at the same time, arrangement of transport for taking the casualty to hospital should be made. Continue cooling the affected area until the pain is relieved. Step 3: Gently remove any ring, watch, belt and", "shoes before the tissues begin to swell. Carefully remove burnt clothing, if it is not sticking to the skin. Step 4: Cover the injured area with a sterile dressing to protect it from infection. Step 5: Gather and record details of the injury. Record the level of response, pulse and breathing carefully. Step 6: While waiting for the help to arrive, keep reassuring the casualty. In case of burn of the face, do not cover the injury because it may cause discomfort to the victim. Keep cooling the area till the doctor arrives. (b) First Aid for Mild Burn In case of mild burns, first aid is given to : \u2022 relieve pain and swelling. \u2022 minimise the risk of", "infection. In case of mild burns, one should : Step 1: Pour cold water on the injured part for minimum 10 minutes, to relieve pain. If water is not available, then any harmless cold liquid (for example, milk) may be used. any person who was given first aid for burn injuries. Share the experience in \u2022 Break blisters. \u2022 Interfere with the \u2022 Apply adhesive \u2022 Apply ointments or fats, as they First Aid and Safety Step 2: Remove gently any ring, watch, belt and shoes before the tissues begin to swell.

One should be aware of two significant facts given in boxes 12.5 and 12.6. (c) First Aid for Injuries on the Play Field Injuries which occur as a result of participation in the sports activity are known as sports injuries or athletic injuries. There are various types of sports injuries. These are mentioned in the following table 12.1. Abrasion (falling on rough or firm surface) Laceration (tears in the skin) Incision (cut by a sharp edge of an object) Puncture wound (pierced by a sharp and Avulsion (tearing", "away of a part of the skin) Contusion (Bruise caused by the direct blow to some part of the body. For example: Knee of a player is knocked against thigh of Sprain (Injury of ligament of joints, caused by the violent overstretching of ligament in a joint or the movement of the joint in abnormal directions. It is characterised by pain, tenderness, swelling at the joint. Strain (Injury of muscle or tendon, three types\u2013 mild, moderate, severe). Joint injuries Joint injuries are very common in sports they are known as joint dislocation. \u201cDislocation is the displacement of contiguous surfaces of two or more bones which are in a joint.\u201d Causes: An external force which forces the joint to move beyond", "the limits of a joint. If the joint is forced to move in an abnormal direction, this dislocation can be a complete or a partial displacement of the bones. These are thickening of the epidermis. It usually occurs in the palm of the hands or on the sole of the foot due to constant friction calluses crack then it will cause a very painful condition. Sometimes a blister may develop under the callus. When it becomes very hard, to prevent cracking, soak the body part in the water for some time and then scrub it off. If it gets infected then consult a doctor. These are caused by the deposition of a type of colourless fluid in between the dermis", "and epidermis. Sometimes this fluid may be blood stained; this is due to the damage of the blood vessels caused frictional force. It is normally seen on the hand or palm or on big toe. Blisters should not be cut, rather the fluid inside can be removed by a sterile syringe, but only by a doctor. Health and Physical Education \u2014 Class IX Fractures (Fracture is a break in the continuity of the bone. The fractures can be open/compound fracture or a closed/simple fracture. Severity of the fracture varies from the mild crack in the bone to the severe shattering of the bone into many pieces. Since prevention is better than cure, it then becomes essential to take appropriate precautions.", "Make the area in and around the play field hazard free. In order to prevent injuries proper warm up is required prior to executing vigorous movements. Similarly, use of appropriate physical conditioning is essential to avoid injury. First aid for strains, sprains, contusions is packaged in the abbreviation RICE which is Rest, Icing, Compression and Elevation as shown in Box 12.5. \u2022 Stop using injured part or discontinue activity. It could cause further injury, delay healing, increase pain and stimulate bleeding. \u2022 Use crutches to avoid bearing weight on injuries of the leg, knee, ankle and foot. \u2022 Use splint for injuries of the arm, elbow, wrist and hand. \u2022 Ice application contracts blood vessels. \u2022 Helps stop internal bleeding", "from injured capillaries and \u2022 Hastens healing time by reducing swelling around injury. \u2022 Keep damp or dry cloth between skin and ice pack. \u2022 Do not apply ice for longer than 15 to 20 minutes at a \u2022 Apply every hour for 10 to 20 minutes. \u2022 Apply ice as long as pain or inflammation persists. \u2022 Hastens healing time by reducing swelling around injury. \u2022 Decreases seeping of fluid into injured area from adjacent \u2022 Use elasticised bandage, compression sleeve, or cloth. \u2022 Wrap injured part firmly. \u2022 Do not impair blood supply. \u2022 Too tight bandage may cause more swelling. \u2022 Wrap over ice. \u2022 Loosen the bandage if it gets too tight.

Therefore, unless there is an emergency, wait for some means of medical evacuation to be provided.
